proper to obviate an objection, which
she finds has already been suggested, that they
were originally written with a view to publication.
She declares, therefore, that no such
idea was ever expressed by Mr. Sancho; and
that not a single letter is here printed from
any duplicate preserved by himself, but all
have been collected from the various friends
to whom they were addressed. Her motives
for laying them before the publick were, the
desire of shewing that an untutored African
may possess abilities equal to an European;
and the still superior motive, of wishing to
serve his worthy family. And she is happy
in thus publicly acknowledging she has not
found the world inattentive to the voice of

<div class="noindent">
<p class="firstpara">THE extraordinary Negro, whose Life I
am about to write, was born A. D. 1729, on
board a ship in the Slave trade, a few days
after it had quitted the coast of Guinea
for the Spanish West-Indies; and, at Carthagena,
he received from the hand of
the Bishop, Baptism, and the name of Ignatius.</p>
</div>

<p>A disease of the new climate put an early
period to his mother’s existence; and his
father defeated the miseries of slavery by an
act of suicide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[p. vi]</span></p>

<p>At little more than two years old, his
master brought him to England, and gave
him to three maiden sisters, resident at
Greenwich; whose prejudices had unhappily
taught them, that African ignorance was the
only security for his obedience, and that to
enlarge the mind of their slave would go
near to emancipate his person. The petulance
of their disposition surnamed him Sancho,
from a fancied resemblance to the ’Squire
of Don Quixote.</p>

<p>But a patron was at hand, whom Ignatius
Sancho had merit enough to conciliate at a
very early age.</p>

<p>The late Duke of Montagu lived on
Blackheath: he accidentally saw the little
Negro, and admired in him a native frankness
of manner as yet unbroken by servitude,
and unrefined by education&mdash;he brought him
frequently home to the Duchess, indulged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[p. vii]</span>
his turn for reading with presents of books,
and strongly recommended to his mistresses
the duty of cultivating a genius of such apparent
fertility.</p>

<p>His mistresses, however, were inflexible,
and even threatened on angry occasions to
return Ignatius Sancho to his African slavery.
The love of freedom had increased with
years, and began to beat high in his bosom.&mdash;Indignation,
and the dread of constant reproach
arising from the detection of an
amour, infinitely criminal in the eyes of
three Maiden Ladies, finally determined him
to abandon the family.</p>

<p>His noble patron was recently dead.&mdash;Ignatius
flew to the Duchess for protection,
who dismissed him with reproof.&mdash;He retired
from her presence in a state of despondency
and stupefaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[p. viii]</span></p>

<p>Enamoured still of that liberty, the scope
of whose enjoyment was now limited to his
last five shillings, and resolute to maintain it
with life, he procured an old pistol for
purposes which his father’s example had
suggested as familiar, and had sanctified as
hereditary.</p>

<p>In this frame of mind the futility of remonstrance
was obvious. The Duchess secretly
admired his character; and at length
consented to admit him into her household,
where he remained as butler till her death,
when he found himself, by her Grace’s bequest
and his own œconomy, possessed of
seventy pounds in money, and an annuity of
thirty.</p>

<p>Freedom, riches, and leisure, naturally
led a disposition of African texture into indulgences;
and that which dissipated the
mind of Ignatius completely drained the
purse. In his attachment to women, he displayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[p. ix]</span>
a profuseness which not unusually
characterizes the excess of the passion.&mdash;Cards
had formerly seduced him; but an
unsuccessful contest at cribbage with a Jew,
who won his cloaths, had determined him
to abjure the propensity which appears to
be innate among his countrymen.&mdash;A French
writer relates, that in the kingdoms of
Ardrah, Whydah, and Benin, a Negro
will stake at play his fortune, his children,
and his liberty. Ignatius loved the theatre
to such a point of enthusiasm, that his last
shilling went to Drury-Lane, on Mr. Garrick’s
representation of Richard.&mdash;He had
been even induced to consider the stage as
a resource in the hour of adversity, and his
complexion suggested an offer to the manager
of attempting Othello and Oroonoko;
but a defective and incorrigible articulation
rendered it abortive.</p>

<p>He turned his mind once more to service,
and was retained a few months by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[p. x]</span>
Chaplain at Montagu-house. That roof
had been ever auspicious to him; and the
present Duke soon placed him about his
person, where habitual regularity of life led
him to think of a matrimonial connexion,
and he formed one accordingly with a very
deserving young woman of West-Indian
origin.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the year 1773, repeated
attacks of the gout and a constitutional
corpulence rendered him incapable
of farther attendance in the Duke’s family.</p>

<p>At this crisis, the munificence which had
protected him through various vicissitudes
did not fail to exert itself; with the result
of his own frugality, it enabled him and his
wife to settle themselves in a shop of grocery,
where mutual and rigid industry decently
maintained a numerous family of
children, and where a life of domestic virtue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[p. xi]</span>
engaged private patronage, and merited
public imitation.</p>

<p>In December, 1780, a series of complicated
disorders destroyed him.</p>

<div class="noindent">
<p><span class="figline3"><img src="images/dec_line.png" alt="" /></span></p>
</div>

<p>Of a Negro, a Butler, and a Grocer,
there are but slender anecdotes to animate
the page of the biographer; but it has been
held necessary to give some sketch of the
very singular man, whose letters, with all
their imperfections on their head, are now
offered to the public.</p>

<p>The display those writings exhibit of
epistolary talent, of rapid and just conception,
of wild patriotism, and of universal
philanthropy, may well apologize for the
protection of the great, and the friendship
of the literary.</p>

<p>The late Duchesses of Queensberry and
Northumberland pressed forward to serve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[p. xii]</span>
the author of them. The former intrusted
to his reformation a very unworthy favourite
of his own complexion.&mdash;Garrick and
Sterne were well acquainted with Ignatius
Sancho.</p>

<p>A commerce with the Muses was supported
amid the trivial and momentary interruptions
of a shop; the Poets were
studied, and even imitated with some
success;&mdash;two pieces were constructed
for the stage;&mdash;the Theory of Music was
discussed, published, and dedicated to the
Princess Royal;&mdash;and painting was so much
within the circle of Ignatius Sancho’s judgement
and criticism, that several artists paid
great <em>deference</em> to his opinion.</p>

<div class="noindent">
<p><span class="figline3"><img src="images/dec_line.png" alt="" /></span></p>
</div>

<p>Such was the man whose species philosophers
and anatomists have endeavoured to
degrade as a deterioration of the human;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[p. xiii]</span>
and such was the man whom Fuller, with
a benevolence and quaintness of phrase peculiarly
his own, accounted</p>

<div class="blockquotfull">

<p>“God’s Image, though cut in Ebony.”</p>
</div>

<div class="noindent">
<p>To the harsh definition of the naturalist,
oppressions political and legislative have been
added; and such are hourly aggravated towards
this unhappy race of men by vulgar
prejudice and popular insult. To combat
these on commercial principles, has been the
labour of Labat, Ferman, and Bennezet&mdash;such
an effort here would be an impertinent
digression.</p>
</div>

<p>Of those who have speculatively visited and
described the slave-coast, there are not wanting
some who extol the mental abilities of
the natives. D’Elbée, Moore, and Bosman,
speak highly of their mechanical powers
and indefatigable industry. Desmarchais
does not scruple to affirm, that their ingenuity
rivals the Chinese.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[p. xiv]</span></p>

<p>He who could penetrate the interior of
Africa, might not improbably discover negro
arts and polity, which could bear little analogy
to the ignorance and grossness of slaves
in the sugar islands, expatriated in infancy,
and brutalized under the whip and the taskmaster.</p>

<p>And he who surveys the extent of intellect
to which Ignatius Sancho had attained
by self-education, will perhaps conclude,
that the perfection of the reasoning faculties
does not depend on a peculiar conformation
of the scull or the colour of a common integument,
in defiance of that wild opinion,
“which,” says a learned writer of these
times, “restrains the operations of the mind
to particular regions, and supposes that a
luckless mortal may be born in a degree
of latitude too high or too low for wisdom
or for wit.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Your</span> friendly letter convinced me that
you are still the same&mdash;and gave in that conviction
a ten-fold pleasure:&mdash;you carried out
(through God’s grace) an honest friendly
heart, a clear discerning head, and a soul
impressed with every humane feeling.&mdash;That
you are still the same&mdash;I repeat it&mdash;gives me
more joy&mdash;than the certainty would of your
being worth ten Jaghires:&mdash;I dare say you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[p. 2]</span>
will ever remember that the truest worth is
that of the mind&mdash;the best rectitude of the
heart&mdash;the conscience unsullied with guilt&mdash;the
undaunted noble eye, enriched with innocence,
and shining with social glee&mdash;peace
dancing in the heart&mdash;and health smiling in
the face&mdash;May these be ever thy companions!&mdash;and
for riches you will ever be more than
vulgarly rich&mdash;while you thankfully enjoy&mdash;and
gratefully assist the wants (as far as you
are able) of your fellow-creatures. But I
think (and so will you) that I am preaching.
I only meant in truth to thank you, which
I most sincerely do, for your kind letter:&mdash;believe
me, it gratifies a better principle than
vanity&mdash;to know that you remember your
dark-faced friend at such a distance. But what
would have been your feelings&mdash;could you
have beheld your worthy, thrice worthy
father&mdash;joy sitting triumphant in his honest
face&mdash;speeding from house to house, amongst
his numerous friends, with the pleasing
testimonials of his son’s love and duty in his
hands&mdash;every one congratulating him, and
joining in good wishes&mdash;while the starting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[p. 3]</span>
tear plainly proved that over-joy and grief
give the same livery?</p>

<p>You met with an old acquaintance of mine,
Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;. I am glad to hear he is well;
but, when I knew him, he was young, and
not so <em>wise</em> as <em>knowing</em>: I hope he will take
example by what he sees in you&mdash;and you,
young man, remember, if you should unhappily
fall into bad company, that example
is only the fool’s plea, and the rogue’s excuse,
for doing <em>wrong</em> things:&mdash;you have
a turn for reflection, and a steadiness, which,
aided by the best of social dispositions, must
make your company much coveted, and your
person loved.&mdash;Forgive me for presuming to
dictate, when I well know you have many
friends much more able, from knowledge
and better sense&mdash;though I deny&mdash;a better
will.</p>

<p>You will of course make Men and Things
your study&mdash;their different genius, aims,
and passions:&mdash;you will also note climes,
buildings, soils, and products, which will
be neither tedious nor unpleasant. If you
adopt the rule of writing every evening your
remarks on the past day, it will be a kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span>
friendly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-a tête</i> between you and yourself,
wherein you may sometimes happily become
your own Monitor;&mdash;and hereafter those
little notes will afford you a rich fund, whenever
you shall be inclined to re-trace past
times and places.&mdash;&mdash;I say nothing upon the
score of Religion&mdash;for, I am clear, every
good affection, every sweet sensibility, every
heart-felt joy&mdash;humanity, politeness, charity&mdash;all,
all, are streams from that sacred
spring;&mdash;so that to say you are good-tempered,
honest, social, &amp;c. &amp;c. is only in fact
saying, you live according to your <span class="smcap">Divine
Master</span>’s rules, and are a Christian.</p>

<p>Your B&mdash;&mdash; friends are all well, excepting
the good Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;, who is at this time
but so, so. Miss C&mdash;&mdash; still as agreeable as
when you knew her, if not more so. Mr.
R&mdash;&mdash;, as usual, never so happy, never so
gay, nor so much in true pleasure, as when
he is doing good&mdash;he enjoys the hope of your
well-doing as much as any of your family.
His brother John has been lucky&mdash;his abilities,
address, good nature, and good sense,
have got him a surgeoncy in the batalion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span>
of guards, which is reckoned a very good
thing.</p>

<p>As to news, what we have is so incumbered
with falshoods, I think it, as Bobadil
says, “a service of danger” to meddle with:
this I know for truth, that the late great
Dagon of the people has totally lost all his
worshipers, and walks the streets as unregarded
as Ignatius Sancho, and I believe
almost as poor&mdash;such is the stability of popular
greatness:</p>

<p>Your brother and sister C&mdash;d sometimes
look in upon us; her boys are fine, well,
and thriving; and my honest cousin Joe
increases in sense and stature; he promises to
be as good as clever. He brought me your
first letter, which, though first wrote, had
the fate to come last; the little man came
from Red-Lion Court to Charles Street by
himself, and seemed the taller for what he
had done; he is indeed a sweet boy, but I
fear every body will be telling him so. I
know the folly of so doing, and yet am as
guilty as any one.</p>

<p>There is sent out in the Besborough,
along with fresh governors, and other strange
commodities, a little Blacky, whom you
must either have seen or heard of; his name
is S&mdash;&mdash;. He goes out upon a rational well-digested
plan, to settle either at Madrass or
Bengal, to teach fencing and riding&mdash;he is
expert at both. If he should chance to fall in
your way, do not fail to give the rattlepate
what wholesome advice you can; but remember,
I do strictly caution you against
lending him money upon any account, for
he has every thing but&mdash;principle; he will
never pay you; I am sorry to say so much of
one whom I have had a friendship for, but
it is needful. Serve him, if you can&mdash;but
do not trust him.&mdash;There is in the same
ship, belonging to the Captain’s band of
music, one C&mdash; L&mdash;n, whom I think you
have seen in Privy Gardens: he is honest,
trusty, good-natured, and civil; if you see
him, take notice of him, and I will regard it
as a kindness to me. I have nothing more
to say. Continue in right thinking, you
will of course act well; in well-doing, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p. 7]</span>
will insure the favour of God, and the love of
your friends, amongst whom pray reckon</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="smcap">Lord</span>! what is Man?&mdash;and what business
have such lazy, lousy, paltry beings of a day
to form friendships, or to make connexions?
Man is an absurd animal&mdash;yea, I will ever
maintain it&mdash;in his vices, dreadful&mdash;in his
few virtues, silly&mdash;he has religion without
devotion&mdash;philosophy without wisdom&mdash;the
divine passion (as it is called) love too oft
without affection&mdash;and anger without cause&mdash;friendship
without reason&mdash;hate without
reflection&mdash;knowledge (like Ashley’s punch
in small quantities) without judgement&mdash;and
wit without discretion.&mdash;Look into old age,
you will see avarice joined to poverty&mdash;letchery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span>
gout, impotency, like three monkeys,
or London bucks, in a one-horse
whisky, driving to the Devil.&mdash;Deep politicians
with palsied heads and relaxed nerves&mdash;zealous
in the great cause of national welfare
and public virtue&mdash;but touch not&mdash;oh! touch
not the pocket&mdash;friendship&mdash;religion&mdash;love
of country&mdash;excellent topics for declamation!&mdash;but
most ridiculous chimera to suffer either
in money or ease&mdash;for, trust me, my M&mdash;&mdash;,
I am resolved upon a reform.&mdash;Truth, fair
Truth, I give thee to the wind!&mdash;Affection,
get thee hence! Friendship, be it the idol of
such silly chaps, with aching heads, strong
passions, warm hearts, and happy talents, as
of old used to visit Charles Street, and now
abideth in fair G&mdash;&mdash;h House.</p>

<p>I give it under my hand and mark, that
the best receipe for your aching head (if not
the only thing which will relieve you) is
cutting off your hair&mdash;I know it is not the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ton</i>; but when ease and health stand on the
right&mdash;ornament and fashion on the left&mdash;it
is by no means the Ass between two loads of
hay&mdash;why not ask council about it? Even the
young part of the faculty were formerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p. 9]</span>
obliged to submit to amputation, in order to
look wise.&mdash;What they sacrificed to appearances,
do thou to necessity.&mdash;Absalom had
saved his life, but for his hair. You will
reply, “Cæsar would have been drowned,
but his length of hair afforded hold to the
friendly hand that drew him to shore.”
Art, at this happy time, imitates Nature so
well in both sexes, that in truth our own
growth is but of little consequence. Therefore,
my dear M&mdash;, part with your hair and
head-achs together; and let us see you spruce,
well-shorn, easy, gay, debonnair&mdash;as of old.</p>

<p>I have made enquiry after L&mdash;&mdash;’s letter.
My friend R&mdash;&mdash; went to demand the reason
for omitting to publish it, and to reclaim
the copy. The publisher smiled at him, and
bid him examine the M. C. of J. 13, where
he would find L. and the same paper of the
20th instant, where he would also find
P&mdash;&mdash; B&mdash;&mdash;’s very angry answer.&mdash;Indeed
the poor fellow foams again, and appears as
indecently dull as malice could with him.
I went to the coffee-house to examine the file,
and was greatly pleased upon the second
reading of your work, in which is blended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span>
the Gentleman and the Scholar. Now,
observe, if you dare to say I flatter, or mean
to flatter, you either impeach my judgement
or honesty&mdash;at your peril then be it.&mdash;For
your letter of yesterday, I could find in my
conscience not to thank you for it&mdash;it gave a
melancholy tint to every thing about me.
Pope had the head-ach vilely&mdash;Spenser, I
have heard, suffered much from it&mdash;in short,
it is the ail of true Geniuses.&mdash;They applied
a thick wreath of laurel round their brows&mdash;do
you the same&mdash;and putting the best foot
foremost&mdash;duly considering the mansion&mdash;what
it had suffered through chance, time,
and hard use&mdash;be thankfully resigned, humble,
and say, “It is well it is no worse!”</p>

<p>I do not wish you to be any other than
nice in what new acquaintance you make.
As to friendship, it is a mistake&mdash;real friendships
are not hastily made&mdash;friendship is a
plant of slow growth, and, like our English
oak, spreads&mdash;is more majestically beautiful,
and increases in shade, strength, and riches,
as it increases in years. I pity your poor
head, for this confounded scrawl of mine is
enough to give the head-ach to the strongest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span>
brain in the kingdom&mdash;so remember I quit
the pen unwillingly, having not said half
what I meant; but, impelled by conscience,
and a due consideration of your ease, I conclude,
just wishing you as well as I do my
dear self,</p>

heartily glad to see you, quoth I&mdash;long
look’d for, come at last.&mdash;Well, we will
have done with that;&mdash;you have made ample
amends for your silence&mdash;have approved
yourself, what I ever esteemed you&mdash;an honest,
hearty, good lad.&mdash;As to your apologizing
about your abilities for writing&mdash;’tis
all a humm&mdash;you write sense;&mdash;and verily,
my good friend, he that wishes to do better
must be a coxcomb.&mdash;You say you was
thrown from your horse but once&mdash;in my
conscience, I think once full oft enough&mdash;I
am glad, however, you escaped so well.&mdash;The
description of your journey I return
you thanks for&mdash;it pleased me much&mdash;and
proved that you looked rather farther than
your horse’s head.&mdash;A young man should
turn travel&mdash;home&mdash;leisure&mdash;or employment&mdash;all
to the one grand end of improving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span>
himself. From your account of Dalkeith,
I now view it “in my mind’s eye” (as
Hamlet says), and think it a delightful spot.&mdash;I
was wrong, I find, in my notions of
the Edinburghers&mdash;for I judged them the
grand patterns for&mdash;cleanliness&mdash;politeness&mdash;and
generosity. Your birth-day entertainments
made a blaze in our papers, which
said, amongst other things, that the puncheons
of rum flood as thick in your park
as the trees&mdash;oh; how I licked my lips, and
wished the distance (400 miles) less between
us.&mdash;You do not say a word about coming
back again.&mdash;Poor Pat has paid his last debt&mdash;peace
and bliss to his spirit! rest to his
bones!&mdash;his wife and daughter (both with
child) and his youngest child all came down;&mdash;what
a scene had I to be spectator of!&mdash;trust
me, James, I cry’d like a whipt school-boy!&mdash;But
then my noble master&mdash;Great
God, reward him!&mdash;Tell me not of ninety
covers&mdash;splendour&mdash;and feasting&mdash;To
wipe away the tears of distress, to make
the heart of the widow to sing for joy&mdash;may
such actions ever (as they have long
been) be the characteristic of the good Duke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span>
of M&mdash;&mdash;! Dr. James, thy favourite,
twice came here:&mdash;at his first visit he gave
no hope&mdash;the next day he came, and poor
Pat had resigned up his spirit two hours
before he got here;&mdash;his Grace paid him
the tribute, the rich tribute, of many tears&mdash;and
ordered me to get a lodging for his
widow and children:&mdash;in the evening he ordered
me to go to them for him&mdash;and acquaint
Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash; how very sensible he
was of her great loss, as well as his own&mdash;that
he would ever be a friend to her&mdash;and
as to the boy&mdash;though he was perfectly well
satisfied with his conduct in his place&mdash;yet,
if he would like any trade better than continuing
his servant&mdash;he would put him out,
and support him through his apprenticeship;&mdash;and
he would give him a year to consider
it.&mdash;Pat has chose to stay, and his Grace
promises whoever uses him ill shall be no
servant here:&mdash;on the night of his interment,
after all was over, the Duke wrote
to the widow himself, and inclosed a twenty
pound bill&mdash;and repeated his promises.&mdash;Your
own heart, my dear James, will
make the best comment&mdash;which is grandest&mdash;one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span>
such action&mdash;or ten birth-days;&mdash;though
in truth the latter has his merit&mdash;it
creates business, and helps the poor.&mdash;I
suppose you will expect me to say something
of our family. Her Grace, I am
truly sorry to say it, has been but poorly
for some time&mdash;and indeed is but indifferent
now&mdash;God of his mercy grant her better
health! and every good that can contribute
to her happiness!&mdash;The good Marquiss
is with us&mdash;Are not you tired? This
is a deuced long letter.&mdash;Well, one word
more, and then farewell. Mrs. M&mdash;&mdash;
is grown generous&mdash;has left off swearing
and modelling. S&mdash;&mdash; is turned Jew, and
is to be circumcised next Passover. W&mdash;&mdash;
is turned fine gentleman&mdash;and left off work&mdash;and
I your humble friend, I am for my
sins turned Methodist.&mdash;Thank God! we
are all pretty hobbling as to health.&mdash;Dame
Sancho will be much obliged to you for
your kind mention of her&mdash;she and the
brats are very well, thank Heaven! Abraham
gives up the stockings&mdash;and monkey
Tom his box&mdash;they both, with all the rest,
join in love and best wishes to your worship.&mdash;I,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span>
for my own share, own myself
obliged to you&mdash;and think myself honoured
in your acknowledging yourself my pupil;
were I an ambitious man, I should never
forgive you,&mdash;for in truth you by far excel
your master:&mdash;go on, and prosper, “Render
unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s;”&mdash;laugh
at all the tall boys in the

joy, no felicity!&mdash;Cruel absence, thou lover’s

dost thou inflict! Cheer up, my child of discretion&mdash;and
comfort yourself that every day
will bring the endearing moment of meeting,
so much nearer&mdash;chew the cud upon rapture
in reversion&mdash;and indulge your fancy with the
sweet food of intellectual endearments;&mdash;paint
in your imagination the thousand graces

lucky trial of her constancy.&mdash;I don’t wonder
the cricket-match yielded no amusement&mdash;all
sport is dull, books unentertaining&mdash;Wisdom’s
self but folly&mdash;to a mind under Cupidical
influence.&mdash;I think I behold you with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span>
supple-jack in hand&mdash;your two faithful happy
companions by your side&mdash;complimenting
like courtiers every puppy they meet&mdash;yourself
with eyes fixed in a lover-like rumination&mdash;and
arms folded in sorrow’s knot&mdash;pace
slowly thro’ the meadows.&mdash;I have done&mdash;for
too much truth seldom pleases folks in
love.&mdash;We came home from our Highland
excursion last Monday night, safe and well&mdash;after
escaping manifold dangers.&mdash;Mesdames
H&mdash;&mdash;, D&mdash;&mdash;, and self, went into the
post-coach, and were honour’d with the
freedom of Dumbarton. By an overset, the
ladies shewed their&mdash;delicacy&mdash;and I my
activity<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; his humanity;&mdash;all

some worthy souls on the spot, which I
admire more than the buildings and prospects.&mdash;We
had herrings in perfection&mdash;and would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span>
have had mackarel; but the scoundrels were
too sharp for us&mdash;and would not be caught.
The Loch-Loman&mdash;Ben-Loman&mdash;Domiquith&mdash;and
Arsenhoe&mdash;with Hamilton and
Douglas houses&mdash;are by much too long for
description by letter.&mdash;We paraded to Edinburgh
last Friday in a post coach and four;&mdash;H&mdash;&mdash;
D&mdash;&mdash;, Mrs. M&mdash;&mdash;, housekeeper,
and self, were the party;&mdash;we saw the usual
seeings, and dined at Lord Chief Baron’s,
but&mdash;dare I tell you?&mdash;H&mdash;’s figure attracted
universal admiration.&mdash;True!&mdash;Alas, poor
K&mdash;&mdash;!&mdash;but, man, never fret&mdash;my honesty
to a rotten egg&mdash;we bring her home sound.&mdash;We
read a shocking account in the papers
of a storm of rain at Richmond Gardens, and
distress, &amp;c. &amp;c. is it true? if so, why did
not you mention it? H&mdash;&mdash; sends her service
to you, M&mdash;&mdash; his best respects&mdash;and all their
best wishes to you and birds.&mdash;Your confounded
epistle cost me seven pence;&mdash;deuce
take you, why did not you inclose it?&mdash;So
you do not like Eloisa&mdash;you are a noddy for
that&mdash;read it till you do like it.&mdash;I am glad
you have seen Cymon;&mdash;that you like it,
does but little credit to your taste&mdash;for every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p. 28]</span>
body likes it&mdash;I can afford you no more
time&mdash;for I have three letters to write besides
this scrawl.&mdash;I hear nothing of moving as
yet&mdash;pray God speed us southward! though
we have fine weather&mdash;fine beef&mdash;fine ale&mdash;and
fine ladies.</p>

<p class="firstpara">NOTHING could possibly be more welcome
than the favor of your truly obliging
letter, which I received the day before yesterday.&mdash;Know,
my worthy young man&mdash;that
it’s the pride of my heart when I reflect that,
through the favor of Providence, I was the
humble means of good to so worthy an
object.&mdash;May you live to be a credit to your
great and good friends, and a blessing and comfort
to your honest parents!&mdash;May you, my
child, pursue, through God’s mercy, the
right paths of humility, candour, temperance,
benevolence&mdash;with an early piety, gratitude,
and praise to the Almighty Giver of all
your good?&mdash;gratitude&mdash;and love for the
noble and generous benefactiors his providence
has so kindly moved in your behalf!
Ever let your actions be such as your own
heart can approve&mdash;always think before you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span>
speak, and pause before you act&mdash;always suppose
yourself before the eyes of Sir William&mdash;and
Mr. Garrick.&mdash;To think justly, is the
way to do rightly&mdash;and by that means you
will ever be at peace within.&mdash;I am happy to
hear Sir W&mdash;&mdash; cares so much about your
welfare&mdash;his character is great, because it is
good;&mdash;as to your noble friend Mr. Garrick&mdash;his
virtues are above all praise&mdash;he has not
only the best head in the world, but the best
heart also;&mdash;he delights in doing good.&mdash;Your
father and mother called on me last
week, to shew me a letter which Mr. Garrick
has wrote to you&mdash;keep it, my dear boy, as
a treasure beyond all price&mdash;it would do
honor to the pen of a divine&mdash;it breathes the
spirit of father&mdash;friend&mdash;and christian!&mdash;indeed
I know no earthly being that I can
reverence so much as your exalted and noble
friend and patron Mr. Garrick.&mdash;Your
father and mother, I told you, I saw lately&mdash;they
were both well, and their eyes overflowed
at the goodness of your noble patrons&mdash;and
with the honest hope that you
would prove yourself not unworthy of their
kindness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span></p>

<p>I thank you for your kindness to my poor
black brethren&mdash;I flatter myself you will find
them not ungrateful&mdash;they act commonly
from their feelings: I have observed a dog
will love those who use him kindly&mdash;and
surely, if so, negroes in their state of ignorance
and bondage will not act less generously,
if I may judge them by myself&mdash;I should suppose
kindness would do any thing with them;&mdash;my
soul melts at kindness&mdash;but the contrary&mdash;I
own with shame&mdash;makes me almost a
savage.&mdash;If you can with conveniency&mdash;when
you write again&mdash;send me half a dozen
cocoa-nuts, I shall esteem them for your sake&mdash;but
do not think of it if there is the least
difficulty.&mdash;In regard to wages, I think you
acted quite right&mdash;don’t seek too hastily to
be independent&mdash;it is quite time enough yet
for one of your age to be your own master.&mdash;Read
Mr. Garrick’s letter night and morning&mdash;put
it next your heart&mdash;impress it on your
memory&mdash;and may the God of all Mercy
give you grace to follow his friendly dictates!&mdash;I
shall ever truly rejoice to hear from you&mdash;and
your well-doing will be a comfort to
me ever; it is not in your own power and option<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span>
to command riches&mdash;wisdom and health
are immediately the gift of God&mdash;but it is in
your own breast to be good&mdash;therefore, my
dear child, make the only right election&mdash;be
good, and trust the rest to God; and remember
he is about your bed, and about your
paths, and spieth out all your ways. I am,
with pride and delight,</p>

shun lyars&mdash;be above revenge;&mdash;if
any have taken advantage either of your
guilt or distress, punish them with forgiveness&mdash;and
not only so&mdash;but, if you can
serve them any future time, do it&mdash;you

in your own person&mdash;therefore gratefully remember
it, and shew mercy likewise.</p>

long met with: if it lays in your way, I

already&mdash;and if you have, it is worth a second

<p class="firstpara">I PROTEST, my dear Madam, there is
nothing so dangerous to the calm philosophic
temper of fifty&mdash;as a friendly epistle from a
pretty young woman;&mdash;but when worth&mdash;benevolence&mdash;and
a train of amiabilities&mdash;easier
felt than described&mdash;join in the attack,&mdash;the
happy receiver of such an epistle must
feel much in the same manner as your humble
servant did this day;&mdash;but I did not mean
to write a starch complimentary letter&mdash;and
I believe you will think I have flourished rather
too much;&mdash;here then I recover my
wits&mdash;and the first use I make of them is to
thank you, in Mrs. Sancho’s name, for
your friendly enquiries&mdash;and to assure you,
we both rejoice that you had so pleasant a
passage&mdash;and that you enjoy your health.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span>
We hope also, that your young gallant will
repay your humane attentions&mdash;with grateful
regard&mdash;and dutiful attachment.&mdash;I beg
your pardon, over and over, for my blundering
forgetfulness of your kind order&mdash;it
was occasioned by being obliged to say goodbye.&mdash;Taking
leave of those we esteem is, in
my opinion, unpleasant!&mdash;the parting of
friends is a kind of temporary mourning.
Mrs. Sancho is but indifferent&mdash;the hot weather
does not befriend her&mdash;but time will, I
hope;&mdash;if true worth could plead an exemption
from pain and sickness&mdash;Miss L&mdash;&mdash;
and Mrs. Sancho would, by right divine,
enjoy the best health&mdash;but, God be blessed!
there is a reward in store for both, and all
like them&mdash;which will amply repay them for
the evils and cross accidents of this foolish
world. I saw Miss and Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;, and
Johnny, at church last Sunday&mdash;they all
looked pleasant, and told me they had heard
you were well.&mdash;I would recommend a poem,
which, if you have not, you should read&mdash;it
is called Almeria; I have not read it&mdash;but
have heard such an account of it as makes
me suspect it will be worth your notice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span>
This end of the town is fairly Regatta-mad&mdash;and
the prices they ask are only five shillings
each seat.&mdash;They are building scaffoldings on
Westminster-hall&mdash;and the prayers of all parties
is now for a fine evening&mdash;May your
evenings be ever fair&mdash;and mornings bright!
I should have said nights happy&mdash;all in God’s
good time! which, you must be convinced,
is the best time.&mdash;Lydia mends&mdash;she walks a
little&mdash;we begin to encourage hope&mdash;Kitty is
as lively as ever&mdash;and almost goes alone&mdash;the
rest are well.&mdash;Mrs. Sancho joins me in
cordial wishes for your health and wealth.&mdash;I

her picture.&mdash;I have wrote to her&mdash;but my
pen is not able to express what I feel&mdash;and I
think Mr. Gardner has hit off her likeness
exceeding well;&mdash;my chimney-piece now&mdash;fairly
imitates the times&mdash;a flashy fine outside&mdash;the
only intrinsic nett worth, in my
possession, is Mrs. Sancho&mdash;whom I can compare
to nothing so properly as to a diamond in
the dirt&mdash;but, my friend, that is Fortune’s
fault, not mine&mdash;for had I power, I would
case her in gold.&mdash;When heard you from
our friend Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; N&mdash;&mdash;? when you
see or write to him&mdash;tell him we still care
for him&mdash;and remember his easy good-nature

I have been so often obliged to you,

trouble you. Commend me to squire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span>
S&mdash;&mdash;, and all worthy friends.&mdash;Lydia sends
her love to you&mdash;she trots about amazingly&mdash;and

addition, that she is as mischievous as a

something of the arrangement of a table and

him a decent character&mdash;he leaves
him at his own (Blacky’s) request:&mdash;he

Teague, would be glad of a good master&mdash;if
any good master would be glad of him.&mdash;As
I believe you associate chiefly with
good-hearted folks&mdash;it is possible your interest

<p class="firstpara">JUST upon the stroke of eleven&mdash;as I
was following (like a good husband) Mrs.
Sancho to bed&mdash;a thundering rap called me
to the street-door&mdash;A letter from Tunbridge,
Sir!&mdash;thanks many thanks&mdash;good
night.&mdash;I hugged the fair stranger&mdash;and&mdash;as
soon as up stairs&mdash;broke open the seal
with friendly impatience&mdash;and got decently
trimmed, for what? why, truly, for having
more honesty than prudence.&mdash;Well, if
ever I say a civil thing again to any of your
sex&mdash;but it is foolish to be rash in resolves&mdash;seriously,
if aught at any time slips from
my unguarded pen, which you may deem
censurable&mdash;believe me truly and honestly&mdash;it
is the error of uncultivated nature&mdash;and
I will trust the candour of friendship to
wink at undesigned offence;&mdash;not but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span>
could defend&mdash;and would against any but
yourself&mdash;the whole sad charge of flattery&mdash;but
enough.&mdash;I paid a visit in Bond Street
this morning.&mdash;Your sister looked health itself&mdash;she
was just returned from the country,
and had the pleasure to hear from you at
her first entrance.</p>

<p>Your friendly offer for the little stranger
is in character&mdash;but if I was to say what
my full heart would dictate&mdash;you would
accuse me of flattery.&mdash;Mrs. Sancho is more
than pleased&mdash;I won’t say what I am&mdash;but
if you love to give pleasure, you have your
will.&mdash;Are you not pleased to find Miss
Butterfield innocent?&mdash;It does credit to my
judgement, for I never believed her guilty&mdash;her
trial proves undeniably that one half
of the faculty are very ignorant.&mdash;I hear
she intends suing for damages&mdash;and if ever
any one had a right to recover, she certainly
has;&mdash;and were I to decree them&mdash;they
should not be less than 400<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i> a year for
life, and 5000 pound down by way of
smart-money.&mdash;In my opinion, the D&mdash;&mdash;ss
of K&mdash;&mdash; is honoured, to be mentioned
in the same paper with Miss Butterfield&mdash;You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p. 70]</span>
should read the St. James’s Evening
papers for last week&mdash;you will easily get
them at any coffee-house&mdash;the affair is too
long for a letter&mdash;but I will send you some
black poetry upon the occasion:</p>

please me&mdash;for to the best of my
knowledge, he reads prayers better than most&mdash;Mr.
B&mdash;&mdash; not excepted; there is a dignity
of expression in his Psalms, which
catches the whole attention&mdash;and such an
animated strength of devotion in his Litany,
as almost carries the heart to the gates of
Heaven&mdash;he is fine in the pulpit;&mdash;but
comparisons are unfair&mdash;if H&mdash;&mdash; reads
prayers, and D&mdash;&mdash; preaches, at the same
church&mdash;I should suppose greater perfection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span>
could not be found in England.&mdash;I have to
thank you for the honor of your correspondence&mdash;and

sense for my farrago of absurdities&mdash;but
you will, I hope, soon be in town.&mdash;Mrs.

<p class="salut">REVEREND SIR,</p>

<p class="firstpara">IT would be an insult to your humanity
(or perhaps look like it) to aplogize for the
liberty I am taking.&mdash;I am one of those
people whom the vulgar and illiberal call
“<em>Negurs</em>.”&mdash;The first part of my life was
rather unlucky, as I was placed in a family who
judged ignorance the best and only security
for obedience.&mdash;A little reading and writing
I got by unwearied application.&mdash;The latter
part of my life has been&mdash;through God’s
blessing, truly fortunate, having spent it in
the service of the best families in the kingdom.&mdash;My
chief pleasure has been books.&mdash;Philanthropy
I adore.&mdash;How very much,
good Sir, am I (amongst millions) indebted
to you for the character of your amiable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span>
uncle Toby!&mdash;I declare, I would walk ten
miles in the dog-days, to shake hands with
the honest corporal.&mdash;Your Sermons have
touched me to the heart, and I hope have
amended it, which brings me to the point.&mdash;In
your tenth discourse, page seventy-eight,
in the second volume&mdash;is this very affecting
passage:&mdash;“Consider how great a part of our
species&mdash;in all ages down to this&mdash;have been
trod under the feet of cruel and capricious
tyrants, who would neither hear their cries,
nor pity their distresses.&mdash;Consider slavery&mdash;what
it is&mdash;how bitter a draught&mdash;and how
many millions are made to drink it!”&mdash;Of
all my favourite authors, not one has drawn
a tear in favour of my miserable black
brethren&mdash;excepting yourself, and the humane
author of Sir George Ellison.&mdash;I think
you will forgive me;&mdash;I am sure you will
applaud me for beseeching you to give one
half-hour’s attention to slavery, as it is at
this day practised in our West Indies.&mdash;That
subject, handled in your striking manner,
would ease the yoke (perhaps) of many;&mdash;but
if only of one&mdash;Gracious God!&mdash;what a
feast to a benevolent heart!&mdash;and, sure I am,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span>
you are an Epicurean in acts of charity.&mdash;You,
who are universally read, and as universally
admired&mdash;you could not fail.&mdash;Dear
Sir, think in me you behold the uplifted
hands of thousands of my brother Moors.&mdash;Grief
(you pathetically observe) is eloquent;&mdash;figure
to yourself their attitudes;&mdash;hear
their supplicating addresses!&mdash;Alas!&mdash;you
cannot refuse.&mdash;Humanity must comply&mdash;in
which hope I beg permission to subscribe
myself,</p>

soon as received&mdash;but I wanted to know the
quantum that I was to wish you joy of&mdash;as
nothing has yet for certainty transpired.&mdash;I
will hope your legacy from Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; is
handsome:&mdash;you can easily imagine the pleasure
I felt&mdash;in finding she had so amply
remembered poor Mrs. M&mdash;&mdash;. That one
act has more true generosity in it, aye, and
justice perhaps, than any thing I ever knew
of her in her long life:&mdash;it has removed an
anxiety from me which (in spite of self-felt
poverty&mdash;and the heart-felt cares of a large
family) troubled me greatly;&mdash;as to myself,
she used to promise largely formerly, that she
would think of me:&mdash;as I never believed&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span>
was not disappointed.&mdash;More and more convinced
of the futility of all our eagerness after
worldly riches, my prayer and hope is only
for bread, and to be enabled to pay what I
owe. I labour up hill against many difficuties;
but God’s goodness is my support,
and his word my trust.&mdash;Mrs. Sancho joins
me in her best wishes, and gives you joy
also: the children are well&mdash;William grows,
and tries his feet briskly&mdash;and Fanny goes on
well in her tambour-work;&mdash;Mary must
learn some business or other&mdash;if we can

more than your master&mdash;or his master into

to; such as chuse sea service, to be disposed
on board his Majesty’s ships at fifteen years
old, and to be enrolled upon the pension-books
after ten years faithful service, unless
better provided for.</p>

<p class="sp1">Might not there be some plan hit on to
employ the daughters, as well as sons of poor
sailors? Does not our Fisheries (if they
should ever happen to be attended to) open
many doors of useful employment for both
sexes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[p. 104]</span></p>

<p>To defray the above, I would advise the
following methods:</p>

<p>First, The pension of 5<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per</i> man for
20,000, amounts only to 100,000<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i>: let
this be taken from the Irish list; it will surely
be better employed, than in the present mode
for Pensioners of noble blood.</p>

<p>Secondly, Let the book and office keepers
at the different yards, ports, &amp;c. be collected
from under-officers who have served with reputation;
it will be a decent retreat for them
in the evening of life, and only a grateful reward
for past service.</p>

<p>May some able hand, guided by a benevolent
heart, point out and strongly recommend
something of this sort, that the honoured
name of England may be rescued
from the scandalous censure of man-stealing,
and from the ingratitude also of letting
their preservers perish in the time of
peace!</p>

<p class="firstpara">GO-TO!&mdash;the man who visits church
twice in one day, must either be religious&mdash;curious&mdash;or
idle&mdash;whichever you please, my
dear friend;&mdash;turn it the way which best
likes you, I will cheerily subscribe to it.&mdash;By
the way, H&mdash;&mdash;n was inspired this
morning; his text was from Romans&mdash;chapter
the&mdash;verse the&mdash;both forgot;&mdash;but
the subject was to present heart, mind, soul,
and all the affections&mdash;a living sacrifice to
God;&mdash;he was most gloriously animated,
and seemed to have imbibed the very spirit
and manners of the Great Apostle. Our
afternoon Orator was a stranger to me&mdash;he
was blest with a good, clear, and well-toned
articulate voice:&mdash;he preached from the
Psalms&mdash;and took great pains to prove that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[p. 106]</span>
God knew more than we&mdash;that letters were
the fountain of our knowledge&mdash;that a man
in Westminster was totally ignorant of what
was going forward in Whitechapel&mdash;that we
might have some memory of what we did last
week&mdash;but have no sort of conjecture of what
we shall do to-morrow, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;Now
H&mdash;&mdash;n’s whole drift was, that we should
live the life of angels here&mdash;in order to be
so in reality hereafter:&mdash;the other good soul
gave us wholesome matter of fact;&mdash;they
were both right&mdash;(but I fear not to speak
my mind to my M&mdash;&mdash;, who, if he condemns
my head, will, I am sure, acquit
my heart.)&mdash;You have read and admired
Sterne’s Sermons&mdash;which chiefly inculcate
practical duties, and paint brotherly love&mdash;and
the true Christian charities&mdash;in such
beauteous glowing colours&mdash;that one cannot
help wishing to feed the hungry&mdash;cloathe
the naked, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;I would to God, my
friend, that the great lights of the church
would exercise their oratorical powers upon
Yorick’s plan:&mdash;the heart and passions once
listed under the banners of blest philanthropy&mdash;would
naturally ascend to the redeeming
God&mdash;flaming with grateful rapture.&mdash;Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span>
I have observed among the modern Saints&mdash;who
profess to pray without ceasing&mdash;that
they are so fully taken up with pious
meditations&mdash;and so wholy absorbed in the
love of God&mdash;that they have little if any
room for the love of man:&mdash;if I am wrong,
tell me so honestly&mdash;the censure of a friend
is of more value than his money&mdash;and to
submit to conviction, is a proof of good
sense.&mdash;I made my bow to-night to Mrs.
H&mdash;&mdash;; the rest of the rogues were out&mdash;bright-eyed
S&mdash;&mdash; and all.&mdash;Mrs.
H&mdash;&mdash; says that you are hypped&mdash;nonsense!&mdash;few
can rise superior to pain&mdash;and
the head, I will allow, is a part the most
<em>sensible</em>, if affected;&mdash;but even then you
are not obliged to use more motion than
you like&mdash;though I can partly feel the aukward
sensations and uneasy reflections,
which will often arise upon the least ail of
so precious a member as the eye&mdash;yet certain
I am, the more you can be master of
yourself (I mean as to chearfulness, if not
gaiety of mind) the better it will of course
be with you.&mdash;I hope G&mdash;&mdash; is well&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span>
that you ride often to see him I make
no doubt.&mdash;I like the monkey&mdash;I know not
for why, nor does it signify a button&mdash;but
sure he is good-tempered and grateful;&mdash;but
what’s that to me?&mdash;Good-night:&mdash;&mdash;the
clock talks of eleven.</p>

knocks.&mdash;“Have you heard the bad news?”&mdash;No.&mdash;“The
Dutchess of Queensbury died

crushed my incredibility, by saying he had

was also very poorly in health.&mdash;Now the
preceding day, Thursday (the day on which
she expired) I had received a very penitential
letter from S&mdash;&mdash;, dated from St.

believing the family to be all there.&mdash;The

with friends&mdash;the next reduced to a lump
of poor clay&mdash;a tenement for worms!&mdash;Earth
re-possesses part of what she gave&mdash;and
the freed spirit mounts on wings of
fire:&mdash;her disorder was a stoppage&mdash;she fell
ill the evening of the Friday that I last saw
her&mdash;continued in her full senses to the
last.&mdash;The good she had done reached the
skies long before her lamented death&mdash;and
are the only heralds that are worth the
pursuit of wisdom:&mdash;as to her bad deeds,
I have never heard of them.&mdash;Had it been
for the best, God would have lent her a little
longer to a foolish world, which hardly
deserved so good a woman;&mdash;for my own

better so.&mdash;“Whatever is,” &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;I
wish S&mdash;&mdash; knew this heavy news, for many

Grace’s death is the only thing that will
most conduce to his reform.&mdash;I fear neither
his gratitude nor sensibility will be much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span>

upon his fears, and make him do <em>right</em>

night with St&mdash;&mdash;; he called in just now,

<p class="firstpara">THERE is something so amazingly
grand&mdash;so stupendously affecting&mdash;in the
contemplating the works of the Divine
Architect, either in the moral or the intellectual
world, that I think one may rightly
call it the cordial of the soul&mdash;it is the
physic of the mind&mdash;and the best antidote
against weak pride&mdash;and the supercilious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span>
murmurings of discontent.&mdash;Smoaking my
morning pipe, the friendly warmth of that
glorious planet the sun&mdash;the leniency of the
air&mdash;the chearful glow of the atmosphere&mdash;made
me involuntarily cry, “Lord, what
is man, that thou in thy mercy art so
mindful of him! or what the son of man,
that thou so parentally carest for him!”
David, whose heart and affections were
naturally of the first kind (and who indeed
had experienced blessings without number),
pours forth the grateful sentiments of
his enraptured soul in the sweetest modulations
of pathetic oratory;&mdash;the tender mercies
of the Almighty are not less to many
of his creatures&mdash;but their hearts, unlike
the royal disposition of the Shepherd King,
are cold, and untouched with the sweet
ray of gratitude.&mdash;Let us, without meanly
sheltering our infirmities under the example
of others&mdash;perhaps worse taught&mdash;or possessed
of less leisure for self-examination&mdash;let
us, my dear M&mdash;&mdash;, look into ourselves&mdash;and,
by a critical examination of
the past events of our lives, fairly confess
what mercies we have received&mdash;what God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span>
in his goodness hath done for us&mdash;and how
our gratitude and praise have kept pace in
imitation of the son of Jesse.&mdash;such a research
would richly pay us&mdash;for the end
would be conviction&mdash;so much on the side
of miraculous mercy&mdash;such an unanswerable
proof of the superintendency of Divine
Providence, as would effectually cure us of
rash despondency&mdash;and melt our hearts&mdash;with
devotional aspirations&mdash;till we poured
forth the effusions of our souls in praise
and thanksgiving.&mdash;When I sometimes endeavour
to turn my thoughts inwards, to
review the power or properties the indulgent
all-wise Father has endow’d me with,
I am struck with wonder and with awe&mdash;worm,
poor insignificant reptile as I am,
with regard to superior beings&mdash;mortal like
myself.&mdash;Amongst, and at the very head of
our riches, I reckon the power of reflection:&mdash;Where?
where, my friend, doth it
lie?&mdash;Search every member from the toe to
the nose&mdash;all&mdash;all ready for action&mdash;but all
dead to thought&mdash;it lies not in matter&mdash;nor
in the blood&mdash;it is a party, which
though we feel and acknowledge, quite past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span>
the power of definition&mdash;it is that breath
of life which the Sacred Architect breathed
into the nostrils of the first man&mdash;image of
his gracious Maker&mdash;and let it animate our
torpid gratitude&mdash;it rolls on, although diminished
by our cruel fall, through the
whole race.&mdash;“We are fearfully and wonderfully
made,” &amp;c. &amp;c. were the sentiments
of the Royal Preacher upon a self-review&mdash;but
had he been blessed with the
full blaze of the Christian dispensation&mdash;what
would have been his raptures?&mdash;The
promise of never, never-ending existence
and felicity, to possess eternity&mdash;“glorious,
dreadful thought!” to rise, perhaps, by regular
progression, from planet to planet&mdash;to
behold the wonders of immensity&mdash;to pass
from good to better&mdash;increasing in goodness&mdash;knowledge&mdash;love&mdash;to
glory in our Redeemer&mdash;to
joy in ourselves&mdash;to be acquainted
with prophets, sages, heroes, and poets
of old times&mdash;and join in symphony with
angels!&mdash;And now, my friend, thou smilest
at my futile notions&mdash;why preach to thee?&mdash;For
this very good and simple reason, to
get your thoughts in return.&mdash;You shall be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span>
my philosopher&mdash;my Mentor&mdash;my friend;&mdash;you,
happily disengaged from various cares
of life and family, can review the little
world of man with steadier eye, and more
composed thought, than your friend, declining
fast into the vale of years, and beset
with infirmity and pain.&mdash;Write now and
then, as thought prompts, and inclination
leads&mdash;refute my errors&mdash;where I am just,
give me your plaudit.&mdash;Your welfare is
truly dear in my sight;&mdash;and if any man
has a share in my heart, or commands my
respect and esteem, it is I&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

of his own blessed creation&mdash;“meek and
lowly, riding upon an ass.” I am convinced
that the general inhumanity of mankind
proceeds&mdash;first, from the cursed false principle
of common education;&mdash;and, secondly,
from a total indifference (if not disbelief) of
the Christian faith;&mdash;a heart and mind impressed
with a firm belief of the Christian
tenets, must of course exercise itself in a
constant uniform general philanthropy:&mdash;such
a being carries his heaven in his breast!&mdash;and
such be thou! therefore write me a
bitter Philippick against the misusers of Jack-asses;&mdash;it
shall honor a column in the Morning
Post&mdash;and I will bray&mdash;bray my thanks

<p>Mrs. Sancho would send you some tamarinds.&mdash;I
know not her reasons;&mdash;as I
hate contentions, I contradicted not&mdash;but
shrewdly suspect she thinks you want cooling.&mdash;Do
you hear, Sir? send me some
more good news about your head.&mdash;Your
letters will not be the less welcome for talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span>
about J&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;; but pray do not let
vanity so master your judgement&mdash;to fancy
yourself upon a footing with George for
well looking:&mdash;if you were indeed a proof-sheet&mdash;you
was marred in the taking-off&mdash;for
George (ask the girls) is certainly the
fairest impression.</p>

<p>I had an order from Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; on
Thursday night to see him do Falstaff;&mdash;I
put some money to it, and took Mary and
Betsy with me:&mdash;it was Betty’s first affair&mdash;and
she enjoyed it in truth&mdash;H&mdash;&mdash;’s
Falstaff is entirely original&mdash;and I think as
great as his Shylock;&mdash;he kept the house
in a continual roar of laughter:&mdash;in some
things he falls short of Quin&mdash;in many I
think him equal.&mdash;When I saw Quin play,
he was at the height of his art, with thirty
years judgement to guide him. H&mdash;&mdash;,
in seven years more, will be all that better&mdash;and
confessedly the first man on the
English stage, or I am much mistaken.</p>

<p>I am reading a little pamphlet, which I
much like: it favours an opinion which I
have long indulged&mdash;which is the improbability
of eternal Damnation&mdash;a thought which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[p. 126]</span>
almost petrifies one&mdash;and, in my opinion,
derogatory to the fullness, glory, and benefit
of the blessed expiation of the Son of
the Most High God&mdash;who died for the sins
of all&mdash;all&mdash;Jew, Turk, Infidel, and Heretic;&mdash;fair&mdash;sallow&mdash;brown&mdash;tawney&mdash;black&mdash;and
you&mdash;and I&mdash;and every son and
daughter of Adam.&mdash;You must find eyes
to read this book&mdash;head and heart&mdash;with a
quickness of conception thou enjoyest&mdash;with
many&mdash;many advantages&mdash;which have the
love&mdash;and envy almost of yours,</p>

honour!&mdash;As to wealth&mdash;may she have no
more than she can manage with comfort

morning, a little fire was thought necessary&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[p. 133]</span>
in raking up the loose dirty waste stuff

pick up and examine it&mdash;when, behold, it
proved to be the companion of the P&mdash;&mdash;,

pettitoes gave us a good supper last
night&mdash;they were well dressed&mdash;and your pig
was well eat&mdash;it dined us Sunday and Monday.&mdash;Now,
to say truth, I do not love pig&mdash;merely
pig&mdash;I like not&mdash;but pork corned&mdash;alias&mdash;salted&mdash;either
roast or boiled&mdash;I will
eat against any filthy Jew naturalized&mdash;or

you entered that sweet mansion&mdash;stopp’d at

Hull and its environs?&mdash;Do they credit
themselves by esteeming a good-enough

Mrs. Sancho and
her virgins are so, so. Mr. Sancho, the
virgins, well as youth and innocence, souls

in the shop.&mdash;I waited by appointment for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span>

made him read your letter&mdash;and what

&amp;c. most sincerely, and amen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span></p>

<p>When Royal David&mdash;in the intoxication
of success and fullness of pride&mdash;imprudently
insisted upon the numbering of his people&mdash;we
are told, the Prophet was sent to announce
the Divine displeasure&mdash;and to give him the
choice of one of the three of the Almighty’s
heaviest punishments:&mdash;in his choice&mdash;he
shewed both wisdom and true piety&mdash;you
know the rest.&mdash;Now, my friend&mdash;thou
knowest my weakness;&mdash;I sincerely believe
the Sacred Writ&mdash;and of course look upon
war in all its horrid arrangements as the bitterest
curse that can fall upon a people; and
this American one&mdash;as one of the very worst&mdash;of
worst things:&mdash;that it is a just judgement,
I do believe;&mdash;that the eyes of our
rulers are shut, and their judgements stone-blind,
I believe also.&mdash;The Gazette will give
you a well-drest melancholy account&mdash;but
you will see one thing in it which you will
like&mdash;and that is, the humane solicitude of
General Burgoyne&mdash;for the safety and good
treatment indiscriminately of all his camp-artificers
and attendants:&mdash;he is certainly a
man of feeling&mdash;and I regard him more for
the grandeur of his mind in adversity&mdash;than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[p. 152]</span>
I should in all the triumphal pomp of
military madness.&mdash;But let me return, if
possible, to my senses:&mdash;for God’s sake!
what has a poor starving Negroe, with six
children, to do with kings and heroes, and
armies and politics?&mdash;Aye, or poets and
painters!&mdash;or artists&mdash;of any sort? quoth
Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash;. True&mdash;indubitably true.&mdash;For
your letter, thanks&mdash;It should have
come sooner&mdash;better late, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;What
have I to do with your good or evil fortune&mdash;health
or sickness&mdash;weal or woe?&mdash;I am resolved
from henceforth to banish feelings&mdash;Misanthrope
from head to foot!&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Apropos</i>&mdash;not
five minutes since I was interrupted,
in this same letter of letters, by a pleasant
affair&mdash;to a man of no feelings.&mdash;A fellow
bolted into the shop with a countenance in
which grief and fear struggled for mastery.&mdash;“Did
you see any body go to my cart,
Sir?”&mdash;“No, friend, how should I? you
see I am writing&mdash;and how should I be able
to see your cart or you either in the dark?”&mdash;“Lord
in heaven pity me! cries the man,
what shall I do? oh! what shall I do?&mdash;I
am undone!&mdash;Good God!&mdash;I did but go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[p. 153]</span>
into the court here&mdash;with a trunk for the
lady at Captain G&mdash;&mdash;’s (I had two to
deliver), and somebody has stole the other;&mdash;what
shall I do?&mdash;what shall I do?”&mdash;“Zounds,
man!&mdash;who ever left their cart
in the night with goods in it, without leaving
some one to watch?”&mdash;“Alack, Sir, I
left a boy, and told him I would give him
something to stand by the cart, and the boy
and trunk are both gone!”&mdash;Oh nature!&mdash;oh
heart!&mdash;why does the voice of distress so
forcibly knock at the door of hearts&mdash;but to
hint to pride and avarice our common
kindred&mdash;and to alarm self-love?&mdash;Mark, I
do think, and will maintain it&mdash;that self-love
alone, if rightly understood, would make
man all that a dying Redeemer wills he
should be.&mdash;But this same stolen trunk;&mdash;the
ladies are just gone out of my shop&mdash;they
have been here holding a council&mdash;upon law
and advertisements;&mdash;God help them!&mdash;they
could not have come to a worse&mdash;nor
could they have found a stupider or sorrier
adviser:&mdash;the trunk was seen parading between
two in the Park&mdash;and I dare say the
contents by this time are pretty well gutted.&mdash;Last
Sunday I met, coming from church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span>
Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;; he looks well, better than
when you left him.&mdash;I took occasion, as we
were prating about and about your worship&mdash;to
pin Mr. de Groote’s interest upon the
skirts of his feelings;&mdash;he desired, when I
saw him next, I would send him into
Crown-street&mdash;which I religiously performed,
but have not seen Mr. de Groote since;&mdash;in
truth, there is (despight of his nose) so much
of the remains of better times&mdash;somewhat of
the gentleman and artist in ruins&mdash;something
creative of reverence as well as pity&mdash;that I
have wished to do more than I ought&mdash;though
at the same time too little for such a
being to receive without insult from the
hands of a poor Negroe&mdash;(pooh, I do not
care for your prancings, I can see you at
this distance).&mdash;We have agreed upon one
thing;&mdash;which is, I have undertaken to write
to Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; for him, in the way of local
relief;&mdash;I will wager a tankard of porter I
succeed in some sort;&mdash;I will aim at both
sides of him&mdash;his pity and his pride&mdash;which,
alas!&mdash;the last I mean, finds a first-floor in
the breast of every son of Adam. S&mdash;&mdash;
called on me this day, and left a picture for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p. 155]</span>
you at your lodgings&mdash;and a very spirited
head in miniature, of your own doing, with
me&mdash;which I like so well&mdash;you will find it
difficult to get it from me&mdash;except you talk
of giving me a copy&mdash;Self-love again!&mdash;How
can you expect business in these hard times&mdash;when
the utmost exertions of honest industry
can scarce afford people in the middle sphere
of life daily provisions?&mdash;When it shall please
the Almighty that things shall take a better
turn in America&mdash;when the conviction of
their madness shall make them court peace&mdash;and
the same conviction of our cruelty and
injustice induce us to settle all points in
equity&mdash;when that time arrives, my friend,
America will be the grand patron of genius&mdash;trade
and arts will flourish&mdash;and if it shall
please God to spare us till that period&mdash;we
will either go and try our fortunes there&mdash;or
stay in Old England and talk about it.&mdash;While
thou hast only one mouth to feed&mdash;one
back to cloath&mdash;and one wicked member
to indulge&mdash;thou wilt have no pity from
me&mdash;excepting in the argument of health.
May that cordial blessing be thine&mdash;with its
sweet companion ease!&mdash;Peace follows rectitude&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[p. 156]</span>
what a plague would’st thou have
more?&mdash;Write soon if thou dar’st&mdash;retort

have just now received the valuable contents&mdash;of
which said letter was harbinger&mdash;without
either surprize or emotion&mdash;save a kind of
grateful tickling of the heart&mdash;the child of
respect&mdash;and I believe twin-brother of gratitude.&mdash;&mdash;Now
had I heard of an A&mdash;hb&mdash;p

good cheer&mdash;informing the minds of

<p class="firstpara">FULL heartily and most cordially do I
thank thee, good Mr. F&mdash;&mdash;, for your kindness
in sending the books&mdash;that upon the unchristian
and most diabolical usage of my
brother Negroes&mdash;the illegality&mdash;the horrid
wickedness of the traffic&mdash;the cruel carnage
and depopulation of the human species&mdash;is
painted in such strong colours&mdash;that I should
think would (if duly attended to) flash conviction,
and produce remorse, in every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span>
enlightened and candid reader.&mdash;The perusal
affected me more than I can express;&mdash;indeed
I felt a double or mixt sensation&mdash;for while
my heart was torn with the sufferings which&mdash;for
aught I know&mdash;some of my nearest kin
might have undergone&mdash;my bosom, at the
same time, glowed with gratitude and praise
toward the humane&mdash;the Christian&mdash;the
friendly and learned Author of that most
valuable book.&mdash;Blest be your sect!&mdash;and
Heaven’s peace be upon them!&mdash;I, who,
thank God! am no bigot&mdash;but honour
virtue and the practice of the great moral
duties equally in the turban or the lawn-sleeves&mdash;who
think Heaven big enough for
all the race of man&mdash;and hope to see and mix
amongst the whole family of Adam in bliss
hereafter&mdash;I with these notions (which,
perhaps, some may style absurd) look upon
the friendly Author&mdash;as a being far superior
to any great name upon your continent.&mdash;I
could wish that every member of each house
of parliament had one of these books.&mdash;And if
his Majesty perused one through before breakfast&mdash;though
it might spoil his appetite&mdash;yet
the consciousness of having it in his power to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span>
facilitate the great work&mdash;would give an
additional sweetness to his tea.&mdash;Phyllis’s
poems do credit to nature&mdash;and put art&mdash;merely
as art&mdash;to the blush.&mdash;It reflects
nothing either to the glory or generosity of
her master&mdash;if she is still his slave&mdash;except he
glories in the <em>low vanity</em> of having in his
wanton power a mind animated by Heaven&mdash;a
genius superior to himself. The list of
splendid, titled, learned names, in confirmation
of her being the real authoress, alas!
shews how very poor the acquisition of wealth
and knowledge are&mdash;without generosity&mdash;feeling&mdash;and
humanity.&mdash;These good great
folks all knew&mdash;and perhaps admired&mdash;nay,
praised Genius in bondage&mdash;and then, like
the Priests and the Levites in sacred writ,
passed by&mdash;not one good Samaritan amongst
them.&mdash;I shall be ever glad to see you&mdash;and

one needful indulgence, or laying any fellow-subject
under the least self-denying restraint.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, we all know that in noble
families plate is merely ideal wealth&mdash;and
in very many houses of your first connexions
and over-grown fortunes, there are vast quantities
of it old and useless, kept merely for
the antiquity of its fashion, and the ostentatious
proof of the grandeur of ancestry.
Our neighbours the French (if I mistake
not) in the last war had the spirit (when
the treasures of their Grand Monarque were
nearly exhausted) to send their plate generously
to the mint, in aid of national honour
and security. Their churchmen have
often shewn the laity the glorious example
of aiding the state. We, to our immortal
honour, have never yielded them the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[p. 164]</span>
palm in courage, wisdom, or gallantry.
Let every gentleman, whose landed property
exceeds 500<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per annum</i>, give up,
without reserve, his useful family plate, all
except knives, forks, and spoons, which
may be deemed useful and necessary. I
trust, such is the exalted spirit of the British
nobility and gentry, that they will resign
with chearfulness what they can so well
do without. Should this meet (as I hope
it will) with the chearful assent of the
public, let the quantities, so nobly given,
be printed against the names of the patriotic
donors, as a lasting testimony of their
zeal for the public good, and a glorious
proof of the internal riches of this queen
of isles!</p>

SIR,</p>

<p class="firstpara">I AM one of the many who have been
often edified by the graceful eloquence and
truly Christian doctrine of the unfortunate
Dr. Dodd.&mdash;As a Divine, he had, and still
has, my love and reverence; his faults I regret;
but, alas! I feel myself too guilty to
cast a stone: justice has her claims;&mdash;but
Mercy, the anchor of my hope, inclines
me to wish he might meet with Royal clemency&mdash;his
punishments have already been
pretty severe!&mdash;the loss of Royal favor&mdash;the
cowardly attacks of malicious buffoonry&mdash;and
the over-strained zeal for rigid justice
in the prosecution.&mdash;Oh! would to God the
reverend bishops, clergy, &amp;c. would join
in petitioning the Throne for his life!&mdash;it
would save the holy order from indignity,
and even the land itself from the reproach
of making too unequal distinctions in punishments.
He might, by the rectitude
of his future life, and due exertion of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span>
matchless powers, be of infinite service&mdash;as
chaplain to the poor convicts on the river,
which would be a punishment, and, at the
same time, serve for a proof or test of
his contrition&mdash;and the sincerity of a zeal
he has often manifested (in the pulpit) for
the service of true Religion&mdash;and he may
rise the higher by his late fall&mdash;and do more
real service to the thoughtless and abandoned
culprits, than a preacher, whose character
might perhaps be deemed spotless. If
this hint should stimulate a pen, or heart,
like the good B&mdash;&mdash;p of Chester’s, to exert
itself in the behalf of a man who has
formerly been alive to every act of heaven-born
charity&mdash;the writer of this will have
joy, even in his last moments, in the reflection
that he paid a mite of the vast
debt he owes Dr. Dodd as a preacher.</p>

rectitude of principle and humble

good-nature, must make even fools and

with such noble natures as you went

day sowing the good seeds of your future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[p. 169]</span>

comfort and honor of your good
father and family;&mdash;but observe&mdash;I do not
wish you half a million, clogged with the
tears and blood of the poor natives;&mdash;no&mdash;a
decent competence got with honesty&mdash;and
that will keep increasing like the
widow’s cruse, and descend down to posterity
with accumulated blessings.&mdash;You desire
to transfer your share in me to your
brother Joe;&mdash;now be it known to you&mdash;Joe
has interest sufficient in his own natural
right with me, to secure him every attention
in my poor power. But you flatter, my good
friend&mdash;though your flattery carries a good
excuse with it&mdash;you flatter the poor.</p>

<p>I say nothing of politics&mdash;I hate such subjects;&mdash;the
public papers will inform you of
mistakes&mdash;blood&mdash;taxes&mdash;misery&mdash;murder&mdash;the
obstinacy of a few&mdash;and the madness and
villainy of a many.&mdash;I expect a very, very
long letter from you&mdash;in answer to a sermon
I wrote you last year.&mdash;Miss &mdash;&mdash; is still
divinely fair;&mdash;she is a good girl, but no
match for Nabobs.&mdash;Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; is as
handsome as ever&mdash;and R&mdash;&mdash; as friendly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p. 170]</span>
God bless them! feasting or fasting! sleeping
or waking! May God’s providence watch
over and protect them&mdash;and all such!&mdash;Your
brother Frank is a sweet boy&mdash;a painter,
who would wish to draw a cherub, will
find no fitter subject.&mdash;The C&mdash;&mdash;ds&mdash;but
what have I to do with good people, who
will of course all write for themselves?&mdash;so
let them.&mdash;Your father&mdash;Oh Jack! what a
cordial!&mdash;what a rich luxury is it to be able
to contribute, by well-doing, to a father’s,
nay a whole family of kindred love, and
heart-felt affection! what a bliss to add to
all their happiness&mdash;and to insure your own
at the same time!&mdash;May this high pleasure
be thine! and may the God of truth and
fountain of all good enrich thy heart and
head with his spirit and wisdom&mdash;crown
your labours with success&mdash;and guard you
from avarice&mdash;ambition&mdash;and every Asiatic
evil&mdash;so that your native land may receive
you with riches and honor&mdash;your friends

wrong&mdash;but that’s not my affair.&mdash;Fielding
and Sterne both copied Nature&mdash;their
pallettes stored with proper colours of
the brightest dye&mdash;these masters were both
great originals&mdash;their outline correct&mdash;bold&mdash;and
free&mdash;Human Nature was their subject&mdash;and
though their colouring was widely
different, yet <em>here</em> and there some features in
each might bear a little resemblance&mdash;some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[p. 184]</span>
faint likeness to each other&mdash;as for example&mdash;in
your own words&mdash;Toby and Allworthy&mdash;the
external drapery of the two are as wide
as the poles&mdash;their hearts&mdash;perhaps&mdash;twins
of the same blessed form and principles;&mdash;but
for the rest of the Dramatis Personæ,
you must strain hard, my friend, before you
can twist them into likeness sufficient to
warrant the censure of copying.&mdash;Parson
Adams is yet more distant&mdash;his chief feature
is absence of thought. The world affords
me many such instances&mdash;but in the course
of my reading, I have not met with his
likeness, except in mere goodness of heart&mdash;in
that, perhaps, Jack M&mdash;&mdash; may equal
him&mdash;but then he is so confounded jingle-headed!&mdash;Read,
boy, read&mdash;give Tom Jones
a second <em>fair</em> reading!&mdash;Fielding’s wit is
obvious&mdash;his humour poignant&mdash;dialogue
just, and truly dramatic&mdash;colouring quite
nature&mdash;and keeping chaste.&mdash;Sterne equals
him in every thing; and in one thing excels
him and all mankind&mdash;which is the distribution
of his lights; which he has so artfully
varied throughout his work, that, the oftener
they are examined, the more beautiful they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[p. 185]</span>
appear.&mdash;They were two great masters, who
painted for posterity&mdash;and, I prophesy, will
charm to the end of the English speech.&mdash;If
Sterne has had any one great master in his
eye&mdash;it was Swift, his countryman&mdash;the first
wit of this or any other nation;&mdash;but there
is this grand difference between them&mdash;Swift
excels in grave-faced irony&mdash;whilst Sterne
lashes his whips with jolly laughter.&mdash;I
could wish you to compare (after due attentive
reading) Swift and Sterne&mdash;Milton and
Young&mdash;Thomson and Akenside&mdash;and then
give your free opinion to yours ever.</p>

<p class="firstpara">YOUR good father insists on my
scribbling a sheet of absurdities, and gives
a notable reason for it&mdash;that is, ‘Jack will
be pleased with it.’&mdash;Now be it known to
you&mdash;I have a respect both for father and
son&mdash;yea, for the whole family, who are
every soul (that I have the honour or pleasure
to know any thing of) tinctured and leavened
with all the obsolete goodness of old times&mdash;so
that a man runs some hazard, in being seen
in the W&mdash;&mdash;e’s society, of being biassed to
Christianity.&mdash;I never see your poor father&mdash;but
his eyes betray his feelings&mdash;for the hopeful
youth in India&mdash;a tear of joy dancing upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[p. 187]</span>
the lids&mdash;is a plaudit not to be equalled this
side death!&mdash;See the effects of right-doing, my
worthy friend; continue in the tract of rectitude&mdash;and
despise poor paltry Europeans&mdash;titled
Nabobs.&mdash;Read your Bible&mdash;as day
follows night, God’s blessing follows virtue;&mdash;honour
and riches bring up the rear&mdash;and
the end is peace.&mdash;Courage, my boy&mdash;I have
done preaching.&mdash;Old folks love to seem
wise&mdash;and if you are silly enough to correspond
with grey hairs&mdash;take the consequence.&mdash;I
have had the pleasure of reading most of
your letters, through the kindness of your
father.&mdash;Youth is naturally prone to vanity:
such is the weakness of human nature, that
pride has a fortress in the best of hearts.&mdash;I
know no person that possesses a better than
Johnny W&mdash;&mdash;;&mdash;but although flattery is
poison to youth, yet truth obliges me to confess
that your correspondence betrays no
symptom of vanity&mdash;but teems with truths of
an honest affection&mdash;which merits praise&mdash;and
commands esteem.</p>

<p>In some of your letters which I do not
recollect, you speak (with honest indignation)
of the treachery and chicanery of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span>
natives<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.&mdash;My good friend, you should remember
from whom they learnt those vices:&mdash;the
first Christian visitors found them a
simple, harmless people&mdash;but the cursed
avidity for wealth urged these first visitors
(and all the succeeding ones) to such acts of
deception&mdash;and even wanton cruelty&mdash;that
the poor ignorant natives soon learnt to turn
the knavish and diabolical arts which they
soon imbibed&mdash;upon their teachers.</p>

<p>I am sorry to observe that the practice of
your country (which as a resident I love&mdash;and
for its freedom, and for the many
blessings I enjoy in it, shall ever have my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[p. 189]</span>
warmest wishes&mdash;prayers&mdash;and blessings;) I
say, it is with reluctance that I must observe
your country’s conduct has been uniformly
wicked in the East&mdash;West Indies&mdash;and even
on the coast of Guinea.&mdash;The grand object of
English navigators&mdash;indeed of all Christian
navigators&mdash;is money&mdash;money&mdash;money&mdash;for
which I do not pretend to blame them.&mdash;Commerce
was meant, by the goodness of the
Deity, to diffuse the various goods of the
earth into every part&mdash;to unite mankind in
the blessed chains of brotherly love&mdash;society&mdash;and
mutual dependence:&mdash;the enlightened
Christian should diffuse the riches of the
Gospel of peace&mdash;with the commodities of
his respective land.&mdash;Commerce, attended
with strict honesty&mdash;and with Religion for
its companion&mdash;would be a blessing to every
shore it touched at.&mdash;In Africa, the poor
wretched natives&mdash;blessed with the most
fertile and luxuriant soil&mdash;are rendered so
much the more miserable for what Providence
meant as a blessing:&mdash;the Christians’
abominable traffic for slaves&mdash;and the horrid
cruelty and treachery of the petty Kings&mdash;encouraged
by their Christian customers&mdash;who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[p. 190]</span>
carry them strong liquors, to enflame
their national madness&mdash;and powder and bad
fire arms, to furnish them with the hellish
means of killing and kidnapping.&mdash;But
enough&mdash;it is a subject that sours my blood&mdash;and
I am sure will not please the friendly
bent of your social affections.&mdash;I mention
these, only to guard my friend against being
too hasty in condemning the knavery of a
people, who, bad as they may be&mdash;possibly
were made worse by their Christian visitors.&mdash;Make
human nature thy study wherever
thou residest&mdash;whatever the religion or the
complexion, study their hearts.&mdash;Simplicity,
kindness, and charity, be thy guide;&mdash;with
these, even Savages will respect you&mdash;and
God will bless you!</p>

<p>Your father&mdash;who sees every improvement
of his boy with delight&mdash;observes that your
hand-writing is much for the better;&mdash;in
truth, I think it as well as any modest man
can wish:&mdash;if my long epistles do not frighten
you&mdash;and I live till the return of next spring&mdash;perhaps
I shall be enabled to judge how
much you are improved since your last favour.&mdash;Write
me a deal about the natives&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p. 191]</span>
soil and produce&mdash;the domestic and interior
manners of the people&mdash;customs&mdash;prejudices&mdash;fashions&mdash;and
follies.&mdash;Alas! we
have plenty of the two last here&mdash;and what
is worse, we have politics&mdash;and a detestable
Brothers war&mdash;where the right hand is hacking
and hewing the left&mdash;whilst Angels weep
at our madness&mdash;and Devils rejoice at the
ruinous prospect.</p>

<p>Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; and the ladies are well.&mdash;Johnny
R&mdash;&mdash; has favourd me with a long
letter; he is now grown familiar with danger&mdash;and
can bear the whistling of bullets&mdash;the
cries and groans of the human species&mdash;the
roll of drums&mdash;clangor of trumpets&mdash;shouts
of combatants&mdash;and thunder of cannon&mdash;all
these he can bear with soldier-like fortitude&mdash;with
now and then a secret wish for
the society of his London friends&mdash;in the
sweet blessed security of peace and friendship.</p>

<p>This, young man, is my second letter;&mdash;I
have wrote till I am stupid, I perceive&mdash;I
ought to have found it out two pages back.&mdash;Mrs.
Sancho joins me in good wishes&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[p. 192]</span>
join her in the same;&mdash;in which double sense
believe me,</p>

Postscript.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Very short.)</p>

<p class="sp1">It is with sincere pleasure I hear you have
a lucrative establishment&mdash;which will enable
you to appear and act with decency;&mdash;your
good sense will naturally lead you to proper
œconomy&mdash;as distant from frigid parsimony,
as from a heedless extravagancy;&mdash;but as you
may possibly have some time to spare upon
your hands for necessary recreation&mdash;give me
leave to obtrude my poor advice.&mdash;I have
heard it more than once observed of fortunate
adventurers&mdash;they have come home enriched
in purse&mdash;but wretchedly barren in intellects:&mdash;the
mind, my dear Jack, wants food&mdash;as
well as the stomach;&mdash;why then should not
one wish to increase in knowledge as well as
money?&mdash;Young says&mdash;“Books are fair
Virtue’s advocates and friends:”&mdash;now my
advice is&mdash;to preserve about 20<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i> a year for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span>
two or three seasons&mdash;by which means you
may gradually form a useful, elegant, little
library.&mdash;Suppose now the first year you
send the order and the money to your father&mdash;for
the following books&mdash;which I recommend
from my own superficial knowledge as
useful.&mdash;A man should know a little of Geography&mdash;History,
nothing more useful, or
pleasant.</p>

<p>
Robertson’s Charles the Fifth, 4 vols.</p>
<p>Goldsmith’s History of Greece, 2 vols.</p>
<p>Ditto, of Rome, 2 vols.</p>
<p>Ditto, of England, 4 vols.</p>

<div class="noindent">
<p>Two small volumes of Sermons&mdash;useful&mdash;and
very sensible&mdash;by one Mr. Williams, a dissenting
minister&mdash;which are as well as fifty&mdash;for
I love not a multiplicity of doctrines&mdash;a
few plain tenets&mdash;easy&mdash;simple and directed
to the heart&mdash;are better than volumes of controversial
nonsense.&mdash;Spectators&mdash;Guardians&mdash;and
Tatlers&mdash;you have of course.&mdash;Young’s
Night-Thoughts&mdash;Milton&mdash;and
Thomson’s Seasons were my summer companions
for near twenty years&mdash;they mended
my heart&mdash;they improved my veneration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[p. 194]</span>
to the Deity&mdash;and increased my love to my
neighbours.</p>
</div>

<p>You have to thank God for strong natural
parts&mdash;a feeling humane heart;&mdash;you write
with sense and judicious discernment. Improve
yourself, my dear Jack, that if it
should please God to return you to your
friends with the fortune of a man in upper
rank, the embellishments of your mind may
be ever considered as greatly superior to your
riches&mdash;and only inferior to the goodness of
your heart. I give you the above as a sketch&mdash;your
father and other of your friends will
improve upon it in the course of time&mdash;I do
indeed judge that the above is enough at first&mdash;in
conformity with the old adage&mdash;&mdash;“A
few Books and a few Friends, and those well
chosen.” Adieu. Yours,</p>

<a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> Extracts of two letters from Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;e to his Father, dated
Bombay, 1776 and 1777.</p>

<p>“1776. I have introduced myself to Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;, who behaved very friendly
in giving me some advice, which was very necessary, as the inhabitants,
who are chiefly Blacks, are a set of canting, deceitful people, and of
whom one must have great caution.”</p>

<p>“1777. I am now thoroughly convinced, that the account which Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;
gave me of the natives of this country is just and true; that they
are a set of deceitful people, and have not such a word as Gratitude

<p class="firstpara">SHALL I acknowledge myself a weak
superstitious Fool? Yes, I will tell the honest
truth&mdash;you have this foolish letter in consequence
of a last night’s dream&mdash;Queen Mab
has been with me&mdash;aye, and with Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[p. 197]</span>
Sancho too&mdash;for my part, I dare not reveal
half my dream&mdash;but upon telling our night’s
visions over the tea-table at breakfast&mdash;it was
judged rather uncommon for us all to dream
of the same party.&mdash;Now, I own, I have
great reason to dream of you waking&mdash;for
you have been a true and uncommon friend
to me and mine&mdash;neither have I the least objection
to these nightly visits, so as I have
the pleasure to meet you (though but in
vision) in good health. Thy health is the
very thing that I doubt about&mdash;therefore
graciously let us know by the next post that
you are well, and mean to take every prudent
step so to continue. That you have left off
tea, I do much approve of&mdash;but insist that
you make your visitors drink double quantity&mdash;that
I may be no loser. I hope you find
cocoa agree with you&mdash;it should be made
always over-night, and boiled for above fifteen
minutes; but you must caution Miss C&mdash;&mdash;
not to drink it&mdash;for there is nothing so
fattening to little folks. The R&mdash;ns waylaid
my friend R&mdash;&mdash;, and pressed Dame
Sancho and self into the service last Sunday&mdash;we
had a good and social dinner; and Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[p. 198]</span>

you have paid a visit to the camp&mdash;and seen
brother O&mdash;&mdash; in his glory&mdash;I hope he will
have regard to his health, and for profit I do
think it must answer better to him than to
(almost) any other man in the country.

delighteth in Blackamoor greetings.&mdash;We
have no news but old lies&mdash;scoured and

well. We gape and swallow&mdash;wonder and

<p class="firstpara">FOR this month past, we have wished to
hear something about you;&mdash;and every day,
for these two past weeks, have I had it
in serious contemplation to put the question
not to the amiable Miss C&mdash;&mdash;, but to my
friend R&mdash;&mdash;, who, notwithstanding your
friendly excuse, is, I do think, rather culpable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[p. 204]</span>
for his silence.&mdash;But hang recrimination;
your goodness is more than sufficient to exculpate
a thousand such sinners. We thank
you, with heart-felt pleasure, for the information
of our and your dear friend Mrs.
C&mdash;&mdash;’s health, which I hope she will be
careful of, for our and many sakes.&mdash;I have
a favour to beg of her, through your mediation,
which is this&mdash;I have a pair of Antigua
turtles&mdash;the gift of Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, who
kindly burthened himself with the care of
them. The true property is vested in Kitty;&mdash;but
so it is&mdash;we having neither warmth
nor room, and Kitty’s good godmother
having both, and that kind of humanity
withal which delighteth in doing good to
orphans&mdash;I, in the name of Kate and her
doves, do through you&mdash;our trusty council&mdash;petition
Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; in behalf of said
birds.&mdash;Were I poetically turned&mdash;what a
glorious field for fancy flights&mdash;such as the
blue-eyed Goddess with her flying carr&mdash;her
doves and sparrows, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;Alas!
my imagination is as barren as the desart
sands of Arabia;&mdash;but, in serious truth,
the shop (the only place I have to put them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[p. 205]</span>
in) is so cold, that I shall be happy to billet
them to warmer quarters, which shall be
done as soon as Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; announces
her consent, and empowers Molly to take
them in.&mdash;As to news&mdash;we have none worth
heeding!&mdash;your camps have ruined all trade&mdash;but
that of hackney-men. You much
surprize us in the account of your late fair
visitant&mdash;but pleased us more in the account
of O&mdash;&mdash;’s success: the season has been,
through God’s blessing, as favourable as his
friends;&mdash;he is a lucky soul.&mdash;The S&mdash;&mdash;s
are both well, I hope, to whom pray be so
kind to remember us:&mdash;as to friend R&mdash;&mdash;,
tell him, that whatever censure his omissions
in writing may draw upon him, when the
goodness of his heart, and urbanity of soul,
is flung into the other scale, the faulty scale
kicks the beam&mdash;we forgive, because we love&mdash;and
love sees no faults.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sancho joins me in love and good
wishes to both of you.&mdash;Kitty has been very
poorly for above a month past, and continues
but very so, so.&mdash;Betsy mends fast;&mdash;Billy
needs no mending at all&mdash;the rest are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[p. 206]</span>
well&mdash;and all join in respects and compliments
to Nutts.</p>

more. Well, what do you, or can you, say
to it? Oh, envy&mdash;envy!&mdash;but, Mr. Monkey,
the wit and true poetry of that billet must
make amends for the shortness of it.&mdash;This

esteemed a favour that I write at all:&mdash;my

your kind readiness in obliging and

honour, and abilities&mdash;these we should naturally

that is not always the case:&mdash;in the race of
fortune, knaves often win the prize&mdash;whilst
honesty is distanced&mdash;but then mark the end&mdash;whilst

truce with moralizing&mdash;though in serious
truth my heart and spirits are low&mdash;the
noble and good Duke of Queensbury is, I

lose a rare example, and the poor a friend!

fifty years past&mdash;his regularity of life and
serenity of mind are in his favour&mdash;but his
advanced life is against him&mdash;80 odd&mdash;the
great fear is a mortification in his leg&mdash;The

Charles Street, Nov. 29, 1778.</p>

<p class="salut">DEAR S&mdash;&mdash;,</p>

<p class="firstpara">YOURS, dated from Madrass, came safe
to hand.&mdash;I need not tell you that your account
pleased me&mdash;and the style of your letter
indicated a mind purged from its follies,
and a better habit of thinking, which I trust
happily preceded a steadier course of action.&mdash;I
know not whether or not Providence
may not, in your instance, produce much
good out of evil.&mdash;I flatter myself you will
yet recover, and stand the firmer in your future
life, from the reflection (bitter as it is)
of your former.&mdash;I have no doubt but you
received my letter charged with the heavy
loss of your great, your noble, friendly benefactress
and patroness, the good Dutchess
of Q&mdash;&mdash;y: she entered into bliss, July 17,
1777, just two days after you sailed from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[p. 218]</span>
Portsmouth.&mdash;I have now to inform you,
that his Grace followed her October 21st
this year; just fifteen months after his good
Dutchess, full of years and honors: he is
gone to join his Dutchess, and share in the
rewards of a righteous God, who alone
knew their merits, and alone could reward
them.</p>

<p>Thus it has pleased God to take your
props to himself;&mdash;teaching you a lesson, at
the same time, to depend upon an honest
exertion of your own industry&mdash;and humbly
to trust in the Almighty.</p>

<p>You may safely conclude now, that you
have not many friends in England:&mdash;be it
your study, with attention, kindness, humility,
and industry, to make friends where
you are.&mdash;Industry, with good-nature and
honesty, is the road to wealth.&mdash;A wise
œconomy&mdash;without avaricious meanness, or
dirty rapacity&mdash;will in a few years render
you decently independent.</p>

<p>I hope you cultivate the good-will and
friendship of L&mdash;&mdash;. He is a jewel&mdash;prize
him&mdash;love him&mdash;and place him next your
heart;&mdash;he will not flatter or fear you&mdash;so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[p. 219]</span>
much the better&mdash;the fitter for your friend:&mdash;he
has a spirit of generosity&mdash;such are never
ungrateful;&mdash;he sent us a token of his
affection, which we shall never forget.&mdash;Let
me counsel you, for your character’s sake,
and as bound in honour, the first money
you can spare, to send over 20<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i> to discharge
your debt at Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;’s the sadler:&mdash;it
was borrowed money, you know.&mdash;As for
me, I am wholly at your service to the extent
of my power;&mdash;but whatever commissions
you send over to me, send money,
or I stir none;&mdash;thou well knowest my
poverty&mdash;but ’tis an honest poverty&mdash;and I
need not blush or conceal it.&mdash;You also are
indebted to Mr. O&mdash;&mdash;, Bond-street:&mdash;what
little things of that kind you can recollect,
pay as soon as you are able;&mdash;it will
spunge out many evil traces of things past
from the hearts and heads of your enemies&mdash;create
you a better name&mdash;and pave the
way for your return some years hence into
England with credit and reputation.&mdash;Before
I conclude, let me, as your true friend, recommend
seriously to you to make yourself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[p. 220]</span>
acquainted with your Bible:&mdash;believe me,
the more you study the word of God, your
peace and happiness will increase the more
with it.&mdash;Fools may deride you&mdash;and wanton
youth throw out their frothy gibes;&mdash;but
as you are not to be a boy all your life&mdash;and
I trust would not be reckoned a fool&mdash;use
your every endeavour to be a good man&mdash;and
leave the rest to God.&mdash;Your letters
from the Cape, and one from Madeira, I
received; they were both good letters, and
descriptions of things and places.&mdash;I wish to
have your description of the sort and town
of Madrass&mdash;country adjacent&mdash;people&mdash;manner
of living&mdash;value of money&mdash;religion&mdash;laws&mdash;animals&mdash;fashions&mdash;taste,
&amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;In
short, write any thing&mdash;every thing&mdash;and,
above all, improve your mind with
good reading&mdash;converse with men of sense,
rather than the fools of fashion and riches&mdash;be
humble to the rich&mdash;affable, open, and
good-natured to your equals&mdash;and compassionately
kind to the poor.&mdash;I have treated
you freely in proof of my friendship.&mdash;Mrs.
S&mdash;&mdash;, under the persuasion that you are
really a good man, sends her best wishes&mdash;when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[p. 221]</span>
her handkerchief is washed, you
will send it home&mdash;the girls wish to be
remembered to you, and all to friend

disposition of the mind in a great measure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[p. 243]</span>
forms either the heaven or hell in both worlds.&mdash;I
rejoice sincerely at the happiness of Mrs.
W&mdash;&mdash;, and may their happiness increase
with family and trade!&mdash;and may you both
enjoy the heartfelt delight of seeing your
children’s children walking in the track of
grace!&mdash;I have, to my shame be it spoken,
intended writing to you for these twelve
months past&mdash;but in truth I was deterred
through a fear of giving pain: our history
has had little in it but cares and anxieties&mdash;which
(as it is the well-experienced lot of
mortality) we struggle with it, with religion
on one hand, and hope on the other.</p>

<p>Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, whose looks and address bespeak
a good heart and good sense, called on
me.&mdash;I will not say how much I was pleased&mdash;pray
make my kindest respects to your
good partner, and tell him, I think I have a
right to trouble him with my musical nonsense.&mdash;I
wish it better for my own sake&mdash;bad
as it is, I know he will not despise it,
because he has more good-nature:&mdash;I hear a
good report of Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, and that his humanity
has received the thanks of a community
in a public manner.&mdash;May he! and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[p. 244]</span>
you! and all I love, enjoy the blissful feelings
of large humanity!&mdash;There is a plaudit&mdash;as
much superior to man’s as heaven is
above earth! Great God, in thy mercy and
unbounded goodness, grant that even I may
rejoice through eternity with those I have respected
and esteemed here!&mdash;Mrs. Sancho
joins me in love to yourself and Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;.
Your son Jacob is the delight of my girls&mdash;whenever
he calls on us, the work is flung
by, and the mouths all distended with
laughter: he is a vile romp with children.&mdash;I
am, dear Madam, with true esteem and
respect,</p>

simpleton, if his heart is right, and God

likely&mdash;the rogue has a pleasing cherry phiz:
neither so old nor so mouldy as some folks,
not having been rocked in the cradle of flattery&mdash;he

it is the case with me at this present writing.

no ladies, the God or Goddess of silence
would have reigned the whole way:&mdash;for my

refreshing, and pleasant; the delicious bowl

room, and kind hostess&mdash;the friendly converse,
the walk&mdash;the animated flow of soul

Œconomy, we eat fairly half a crown’s
worth.&mdash;Aye, cries Prudence, that alters the
case&mdash;od-so, we are nine pence in pocket,
besides the benefit of fresh air, fresh scenes,
and the pleasure of the society we love.&mdash;The
sky was cloudless, and, to do me a
particular favour, the moon chose to be at
full&mdash;and gave us all her splendor;&mdash;but our
envious mother Earth (to mortify our vanity)
rose up&mdash;rolling the whole way in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[p. 253]</span>
clouds of dust.&mdash;Contention flew in at the

drawing up the glass, we shall faint with
heat.”&mdash;“Oh dear! very sorry to offend your
delicacy; but I shall be suffocated with dust&mdash;and
my cloaths&mdash;” “I have cloaths to
spoil as well as other folks, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.”
The males behaved wisely, and kept a stricter
neutrality than the French with the
Americans.&mdash;I chewed the cud of sweet remembrance,
and, with a heart and mind in
pretty easy plight, gained the castle of peace
and innocence about nine o’clock.&mdash;Well,
Sir, and how do you find yourself by this
time?&mdash;I sweat, I protest&mdash;and then the
bright God of day darts his blessings full upon
my shop-window&mdash;so intensely, that I

upon a gridiron.</p>

that I owe her something more than kind
words and cool thanks!&mdash;therefore tell her,
a man that notes particularly the welcome
of the eye&mdash;and saw plainly good-will and
good-nature in the expression of her honest
countenance&mdash;sends her a dish of tea&mdash;which
she must sweeten by her cheery acceptance
of it&mdash;from one who knows not how to
return the many, many obligations he has
received from the he’s and she’s of P&mdash;&mdash;

petite-parties at quadrille&mdash;and, with their
shining faces and smooth tongues, drain
unwary young men’s pockets, and feminize
their manners.&mdash;But why do I preach to
thee, who art abler to instruct grey hairs

has gulled mighty statesmen, misled poor
me; and for the sake of appearing wiser than
I am, I pray you, “set me down an ass!”

Sire, which I hope he did not send you.&mdash;There

people of observation perceive that the

Thank God! she is neither daughter nor

why do I plague myself about her?
She has a protector in you&mdash;and foul befall

I say again, and again&mdash;when one has
formed a great opinion of either male or
female, ’tis best, for that opinion’s sake, to
look no further&mdash;there, rogue!</p>

<p>I shall take no notice of the tricking fraudulent
behaviour of the driver of the stage&mdash;<em>as
how</em> he wanted to palm a bad shilling upon
us&mdash;and <em>as how</em> they stopped us in the town,
and most generously insulted us&mdash;and <em>as how</em>
we took up a fat old man&mdash;his wife <em>fat</em> too&mdash;and
child;&mdash;and after keeping us half an

his head out of the coach-door, and swore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[p. 265]</span>

indignation&mdash;when&mdash;(after due apologies for
the liberty of this address&mdash;and a few good-natured
protestations of friendship and so
forth&mdash;with an injunction to strict secresy)
I inform you that it is absolutely necessary
for your immediate setting out for Red-lion
Court.&mdash;Your good man is only running after
all the young gypsies about the neighbourhood&mdash;all
colours&mdash;black or fair&mdash;are alike;&mdash;this
is the effect of country air&mdash;and your
nursing.&mdash;The good man made his appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[p. 267]</span>
on Thursday evening last&mdash;the glow of
health in his face&mdash;joy in his eyes.&mdash;“Wife,
Joe, and little Frank all well, and myself
never better in my life;”&mdash;a pretty girl he
led by the hand&mdash;and, as if one petticoat
plague was not enough, he insisted upon
taking away two of mine&mdash;and carried his
point against every reasonable odds: away
they all went to the play&mdash;and God only
knows where else&mdash;I threatened him with a
modest report to Melchbourn, but he seemed
to care very lightly about it;&mdash;so I
humbly advise, as your best method of taming
him, either to insist upon his speedily
coming down to you&mdash;or else your immediate
setting out for home:&mdash;at present he only
attempts our daughters&mdash;but, should you
be absent a month longer, I tremble for our
wives;&mdash;for my part, I have some reason,
for here both wife and daughters are as fond
of Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;e as they dare own&mdash;Seriously,
I think, you should coax him down, if only
for a fortnight; for it is amazing how
much better he is for the short time he was
absent&mdash;and this I take to be the pleasantest
and wholesomest time for the country, if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[p. 268]</span>
evening dews are carefully guarded against&mdash;I
shall advise him strongly to take the other
trip&mdash;and I trust your documents, with the
innocent simplicity of all around him&mdash;fine
air&mdash;exercise&mdash;new milk&mdash;and the smell of
new hay&mdash;will make him ten thousand times
worse than he is&mdash;you won’t like him the
worse for that. My love attends cousins

know nothing of figures&mdash;you write a
wretched hand&mdash;thou hast a nonsensical style&mdash;almost
as disagreeable as thy heart&mdash;thy
heart, though better than thy head&mdash;and
which I wish from my soul (as it now is)
was the worst heart in the three kingdoms.&mdash;Thy
heart is a silly one&mdash;a poor cowardly
heart&mdash;that would shrink at mere trifles&mdash;though
there were no danger of fine or imprisonment:&mdash;for
example&mdash;come, confess
now&mdash;could you lie with the wife of your
friend? could you debauch his sister? could
you defraud a poor creditor? could you by
gambling rejoice in the outwitting a novice
of all his possessions?&mdash;No! why then thou
art a silly fellow, incumbered with three abominable
inmates;&mdash;to wit&mdash;Conscience&mdash;Honesty&mdash;and
Good-nature&mdash;I hate thee
(as the Jew says) because thou art a Christian.</p>

<p>And what, in the name of common
sense, impelled thee to torment my soul,
with thy creative pen-drawing of sweet
A&mdash;r&mdash;bn&mdash;s? I enjoyed content at least in
the vortex of smoak and vice&mdash;and lifted up
my thoughts no higher than the beauties of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[p. 282]</span>
the park or&mdash;&mdash;gardens.&mdash;What have I to
do with rural deities? with parterres&mdash;fields&mdash;groves&mdash;terraces&mdash;views&mdash;buildings&mdash;grots&mdash;temples&mdash;slopes&mdash;bridges
and meandering
streams&mdash;cawing rooks&mdash;billing turtles&mdash;happy
swains&mdash;the harmony of the woodland
shades&mdash;the blissful constancy of rustic
lovers?&mdash;Sir, I say you do wrong, to awaken
ideas of this sort:&mdash;besides, as I hinted
largely above&mdash;you have no talent&mdash;no
language&mdash;no colouring&mdash;you do not groupe
well&mdash;no relief&mdash;false light and shadow&mdash;and

<p class="salut">DEAR FRIEND,</p>

<p class="firstpara">I SHOULD on Sunday night have acknowledged
your kindness, but was prevented
by weakness!&mdash;idleness! or some
such nonsense!&mdash;Were you here, Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[p. 286]</span>
Sancho would tell you I had quacked myself
to death.&mdash;It is true, I have been unwell&mdash;from
colds and from a purging!&mdash;which disorder
prevails much in our righteous metropolis&mdash;and
perhaps from quacking; but
of this when we meet.&mdash;I was much pleased
with my letter from Sir John&mdash;in which
there is very little news&mdash;and less hope of
doing any thing to the purpose, either in the
conquering or conciliating mode, than in
any letter I have been favoured with.&mdash;He
makes no mention of receiving any packets
from me, and I have wrote six or eight times
within the last twelve months&mdash;so you see
plainly the packets are either lost, or his
letters stopt.&mdash;I shall give him a line by
Wednesday’s post&mdash;and let it try its fortune.&mdash;I
enclose you some American congress
notes&mdash;for he does not say he has sent you
any&mdash;though he mentions the news-papers.</p>

<p>We talk of sending over a vast force next
spring. Why G&mdash;m&mdash;t will so madly pursue
a losing game, is amongst the number of
things that reason can never account for&mdash;and
good sense blushes at:&mdash;it is reported in
the city, that our safety this summer was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[p. 287]</span>
purchased of d’Orvilliers and Monsieur Sartin:&mdash;it
is certain (although a vote of credit
was granted for a million) that there is no
money in the Exchequer&mdash;and that the civil
list is 800,000<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i> in arrears.&mdash;This looks dark&mdash;whilst
Ireland treats us rather laconic&mdash;Scotland
not too friendly&mdash;America speaks
but too plainly:&mdash;But what a plague is all
this to you or me? I am doomed to difficulty
and poverty for life&mdash;and let things go
as they will, if the French leave us Newmarket&mdash;they
will not ruin my friend.&mdash;I
hope the good ladies are well and preparing
for London.&mdash;Squire S&mdash;&mdash; and his good
woman well also, he in the enjoyment of his
gun&mdash;and she in the care of the sweet
children.&mdash;My best respects to Mr. and
Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;, and I should be a beast to
neglect my worthy friend Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;k. Now
I have a scheme to propose to the electors of
Great Britain, to take Sir C&mdash;&mdash; and Mr.
S&mdash;&mdash; for their patterns&mdash;and at the
general election (if they can find as many)
to return 300 such&mdash;it would immortalize
them in the annals of this country for their
wisdom of choice&mdash;and what’s much better,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[p. 288]</span>
it would perhaps (with God’s blessing) save
Old England. We want, alas!&mdash;only a few
honest men of sound principles and good
plain understandings&mdash;to unite us&mdash;to animate
with one mind!&mdash;one heart!&mdash;one
aim!&mdash;and to direct the rouzed courage of a
brave people properly&mdash;then we might hope
for golden times&mdash;and the latter end of the
present reign emulate the grand close of the
last.</p>

<p>I got a very pretty young lady to chuse
this inclosed ticket&mdash;meaning to baffle ill-luck;
for, had I chose it myself, I am
certain a blank would have been the consequence.&mdash;May
it be prosperous!&mdash;Mrs.
Sancho joins me in every thing&mdash;love to
O&mdash;&mdash;; the girls giggle their respects to Mr.
R&mdash;&mdash;; Billy joins in silence, but his love
to Nutts is plain. How does he do?</p>

the weal and welfare of his S&mdash;&mdash; are constantly
considered:&mdash;the proposal which accompanies
this letter, from what little judgement
I have, I think promises fair.&mdash;You
will, however, give it a fair examination&mdash;and

say, I think in every light it seems eligible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[p. 298]</span>
The circle of your acquaintance is at present
circumscribed&mdash;I mean in the artist line:&mdash;now

forming acquaintance&mdash;perhaps friendships&mdash;with

may happily change the colour of your fortunes&mdash;the

your case, where in fact one has <em>wit</em>, and
the other <em>judgement</em>,&mdash;the <em>chair</em> of <em>interest</em>
will have its compleat furniture in the two
top ornaments&mdash;and <em>honesty</em> for its <em>basis</em>. So
much for Mons. H&mdash;&mdash;, and now I have
to reckon with you. How could you be so
preposterously wrong, to trouble the repose
of your worthy father and mother about
me? Surely you must think me exceedingly
interested&mdash;or your heart must be
a very proud one; if either&mdash;in the first instance
you did me a wrong&mdash;in the last, perhaps,
I may wrong you;&mdash;be it as it may&mdash;I
know it gave me real vexation.&mdash;Your
father sent such a basket, as ten times repaid
the trifling service I had the honour as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[p. 299]</span>
as pleasure in rendering a man of merit,
and my friend;&mdash;believe me, I never accepted
any present with so ill a will;&mdash;with
regard to them, every thankful acknowledgement
was due.&mdash;I wrote a very embarrassed
letter of thanks&mdash;with a resolution to
give you a chastisement for laying me under
the necessity.&mdash;I hear with pleasure that
you have enough to do. H&mdash;&mdash; declares he
is sorry for it&mdash;as he wants and wishes you
in town. Pray give my best wishes to Mess.
B&mdash;&mdash; and S&mdash;&mdash;w, and my love to O&mdash;&mdash;.
If you should happen to know a Miss
A&mdash;&mdash;, a rich farmer’s daughter, remember
me to her&mdash;were you not widow-witched,
she or some other heavy-pursed lass might
be easily attainable to a man of your&mdash;aye,
aye, but that, says &mdash;&mdash;, will not be, I fear.&mdash;For
I verily believe, that *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* for the

your virtues) addresses you&mdash;will you pardon
the interested intrusion? I am told, you delight
in doing good.&mdash;Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;e (who
honours me with his friendships, by whose
persuasion I presume to trouble you) declares&mdash;you
are no respecter of country or colours&mdash;and
encourages me further&mdash;by saying,
that I am so happy (by the good offices of
his too partial friendship) to have the interest
and good wishes of Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Could my wish be possibly effected to have
the honour of a General post-office settled in
my house, it would certainly be a great good&mdash;as
(I am informed) it would emancipate
me from the fear of serving the parish offices,

all the supercilious mock dignity of
little office&mdash;what a banquet for wicked jest

of being summoned out at midnight in the
severity of easterly winds and frosty weather&mdash;subject
as I unfortunately am to gout six
months in twelve&mdash;the consequence of which
must be death:&mdash;death! now I had much

<p class="salut">DEAR SIR,</p>

<p class="firstpara">THE Park guns are now firing, and never
was poor devil so puzzled as your humble
Sancho is at this present moment.&mdash;I have a
budget of fresh news&mdash;aye, and that of consequence&mdash;and
a million of stale thanks,
which perhaps you will think of no consequence.&mdash;Impelled
by two contrary passions,
how should a poor Negro know precisely
which to obey? Your turkey and chine are
absolutely as good, as fine, and as welcome&mdash;as
nobly given&mdash;and as gratefully accepted&mdash;as
heart can wish, or fancy conceive:&mdash;then
on the other hand&mdash;the news is as
glorious&mdash;as well timed and authenticated&mdash;as
pleasing,&mdash;as salutary in the ministerial way&mdash;as
much wanted&mdash;and as welcome&mdash;as the
turkey and chine to a certain sett, I mean&mdash;of
king’s friends and national *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[p. 303]</span>
said turkey and chine will keep fresh and
good&mdash;and chear some honest hearts (I trust)
on Christmas-day.&mdash;The news, good as it
is, may half of it prove false by Christmas&mdash;and
the true part will be stale news by that
time&mdash;much of it will be liable to doubt
and malicious disquisition:&mdash;now, on the
other hand, the turkey and its honest fat
companion are bettering every day&mdash;and feast
us by anticipation.&mdash;But again, the news
will come with a handsome face&mdash;attested by
a Gazette extraordinary, garnished by the
happy flourishes of news-paper invention.
Then there is the speech of the noble Sir
C&mdash;&mdash;; I meant to say much upon that
score; you have read it without doubt&mdash;so
have I more than once or twice&mdash;and I find
the same fault with it that the majority and
minority do&mdash;which is neither more nor less
than what’s exceeding natural to both parties.&mdash;The
majority detest it for its truth&mdash;the
minority would have better liked it, had
it not been so d&mdash;n’d <em>honest</em>. Now (between
ourselves) I do confess to you, my worthy
friend, strip this famed speech of its truth
and honesty, there will very little worth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[p. 304]</span>
notice remain, excepting candour, a spice of
benevolence, and perhaps too much charity;&mdash;but
as the above are the vices only of a
very few, we may the better endure it in
Sir C&mdash;&mdash;. There is certainly an express
arrived this day with very comfortable news&mdash;plenty
of killed and wounded&mdash;plenty of
prisoners&mdash;and (as it always happens) with
little or no loss on our side;&mdash;but, dear me!
how I have run on!&mdash;I protest, the sole
business of this letter was to ease my mind&mdash;by
unburthening my head and heart of some
weighty thanks, which, for aught I know,
except very decently managed, are more
likely to give pain than pleasure to some odd-constructed
minds, men who fatten upon
doing good, and feel themselves richer in
proportion to their kindness:&mdash;such beings
are the S&mdash;&mdash;’s, the B&mdash;&mdash;s, the R&mdash;&mdash;hs,
O&mdash;&mdash;ns, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;whom God mend&mdash;in
the next world I mean:&mdash;so, wishing you
every felicity in this, and every comfort attendant
on the approaching festival, with
love and good-will to all friends, especially to
Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;n, the worthy Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;’s
family, Squire S&mdash;&mdash;ns, and his mate, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[p. 305]</span>

<p class="firstpara">LOSERS have the privilege to rail&mdash;I
was taking the benefit of the act upon my

(and not disagreeably) stopped my mouth&mdash;with
saying, he had just loaded a stout lad&mdash;in
the name of Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, and dispatched
him to Charles Street:&mdash;now this same
spirit of reparation may suit well with both
the in and out side of Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;; and those
who know the man will not marvel at the

convinced of the blindness, and more than
Egyptian stubbornness, of repiners of every

<p class="firstpara">IT is needless, my dear Sir, to say how
pleasingly the news of your great good fortune
affected us:&mdash;for my part, I declare
(self excepted) I do not know, in the whole
circle of human beings, two people whom I
would sooner wish to have got it;&mdash;neither,
in my poor judgement, could it have fallen
with a probability of being better used in any
other hands. The blessings of decent competency
you have been used to from early
childhood:&mdash;your minds have been well
cultivated&mdash;virtuous and prudent in your
conduct, you have enjoyed the only true
riches (a good name) long;&mdash;your power of
doing good will certainly be amply increased;
but, as to real wealth, I will maintain it, you
were as rich before.&mdash;You must now expect
a decent share of envy;&mdash;for, as every one
thinks pretty handsomely of self, most of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[p. 309]</span>
the unfortunate adventurers of your acquaintance
will be apt to think how much pleasanter
it would have been to have had twenty
thousand pounds to themselves.&mdash;Avarice
will groan over his full bags, and cry,
“Well, I never had any luck!” Vanity
will exclaim, “It is better to be born lucky
than rich!” Whilst Content, sheltered in
her homely hovel, will cry, “Blessing on
their good hearts! aye, I knew their good
parents;&mdash;they were eyes to the blind, and
feet to the lame, and made the orphan’s and
the widow’s hearts sing for joy; God will
prosper the family.”&mdash;But, while I am prating
away, I neglect to thank you, which was
the chief business of this letter&mdash;to thank
you, and to admire that rectitude of temper
which could, in the full tide of worldly good
fortune, remember the obscure, the humble
old friend.&mdash;Accept my thanks, and the
plaudit also of a heart too proud to court
opulence&mdash;but alive to the feelings of truth,
sacred friendship, and humanity.&mdash;Mine

present attend you, Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash;, and the

your favourite&mdash;I scarce knew her;&mdash;she was

<p>I hope you sometimes&mdash;aye often&mdash;consult
with Dr. Young’s Night Thoughts&mdash;carry
him in your pockets&mdash;court him&mdash;quote
him&mdash;delight in him&mdash;make him your
own&mdash;and laugh at the wit, and wisdom,
and fashion of the world:&mdash;that book, well
studied, will make you know the value of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[p. 321]</span>
death&mdash;and open your eyes to the snares of
life; its precepts will exalt the festive hour,
brighten and bless the gloom of solitude,
comfort thy heart, and smooth thy pillow
in sickness, and gild with lustre thy prosperity&mdash;disarm
death itself of its terrors, and
sweetly soften the hour of dissolution.&mdash;I recommend
to all young people, who do me
the honour to ask my opinion&mdash;I recommend,
if their stomachs are strong enough
for such intellectual food, Dr. Young’s
Night Thoughts&mdash;the Paradise Lost&mdash;and
the Seasons;&mdash;which, with Nelson’s Feasts
and Fasts, a Bible and Prayer-book, used for
twenty years to make my travelling library&mdash;and
I do think it a very rich one. I never
trouble my very distant friends with articles
of news&mdash;the public prints do it so much
better&mdash;and then they may answer for their
untruths;&mdash;for among the multitude of our
public prints, it is hard to say which lyes
most.</p>

<p>Your enclosed trust was directly delivered
to the fair hands it was addressed to:&mdash;I
have the authority to say, it gave great pleasure
to both the ladies and your friend Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[p. 322]</span>
R&mdash;&mdash;, who wears the same cordial friendly
heart in his breast as when you first knew
him.&mdash;Your friend Mr. John R&mdash;&mdash; is still
at New York with the guards&mdash;where he is
very deservedly honoured, loved, and esteemed:&mdash;he
corresponds with his old acquaintance&mdash;and
does me the honour to remember me
amongst his friends:&mdash;our toast in P. Gardens
is often the three Johns&mdash;R&mdash;&mdash;,
W&mdash;&mdash;e, and O&mdash;&mdash;, an honest&mdash;therefore
a noble triumvirate.</p>

<p>I feel old age insensibly stealing on me&mdash;and,
alas! am obliged to borrow the aid
of spectacles, for any kind of small print:&mdash;Time
keeps pacing on, and we delude
ourselves with the hope of reaching first
this stage, and then the next; till that ravenous
rogue Death puts a final end to our
folly.</p>

<p>All this is true&mdash;and yet I please and
flatter myself with the hope of living to see
you in your native country&mdash;with every
comfort possessed&mdash;crowned with the honest
man’s best ambition, a fair character.&mdash;May
your worthy, your respectable parents, relations,
and friends, enjoy that pleasure!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[p. 323]</span>

of all who love you, is the wish of</p>

<p class="firstpara">MR. R&mdash;&mdash; faithfully discharged his commission&mdash;paid
me the desirable&mdash;and intrusted
me with ten guineas, to pay on demand;
and here he comes, faith&mdash;as fresh as May,
and warm as friendly zeal can make mortality&mdash;to
demand the two letters, which he
will deliver himself, for his own satisfaction.&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[p. 324]</span>
wish from my soul, that Chancellors&mdash;Secretaries
of State&mdash;Kings&mdash;aye&mdash;and Bishops&mdash;were
as fond of doing kind things&mdash;but
they are of a higher order.&mdash;Friend R&mdash;&mdash;
is only a Christian.&mdash;I give you credit for
your promises of reformation in the epistolary
way&mdash;and very glad am I to hear of
your success.&mdash;Know your own worth&mdash;honour
yourself, not with supercilious pride,
but with the decent confidence of your own
true native merit&mdash;and you must succeed in
almost any thing you chuse to undertake:
so thinks Sancho.&mdash;As to what you request
me to do by way of inspecting your goods
and chattels in your late lodging&mdash;I must
beg to decline it&mdash;as I feel it aukward, to
insinuate the least deficiency in point of attention
to your interests in such a heart
as H&mdash;s; a heart which, to my knowledge,
feels every sentiment of divine friendship
for you; an heart, animated with the strongest
zeal and flowing ardor to serve you, to love
you.</p>

<p>The kindness of you and your two friends
exceedingly embarrasses me.&mdash;I would not
wish to appear to any one either arrogant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[p. 325]</span>
vain, or conceited;&mdash;no&mdash;nor servile, mean,
or selfish:&mdash;I grant your motive is friendly
in the extreme&mdash;and those of your companions
as nobly generous;&mdash;but&mdash;but what?&mdash;Why
this&mdash;and the truth&mdash;were I rich,
I would accept it, and say “Thank ye,”
when I chose it;&mdash;as I am poor, I do not
chuse to say “Thank ye”&mdash;but to those I
know and respect. You must forgive me&mdash;and
call it the error of African false principle&mdash;call
it any thing but coldness and unfeeling
pride, which is in fact ingratitude in
a birth-day suit.&mdash;As to the grand Turk
of Norfolk, if it comes&mdash;we will devour it&mdash;and
toast Don S&mdash;&mdash; and the unknown
giver.&mdash;Thou, my S&mdash;&mdash;, hast (oh! prostrate,
and thank the Giver) a noble and
friendly heart, susceptible of the best, the
greatest feelings. H&mdash;&mdash; is thy twin-brother&mdash;perhaps
he has more fire in his composition:&mdash;Woman

journey to town is wisely great, or greatly
wise;&mdash;it does you honour, because it is
founded in equity. I am glad to hear the
Rev. Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; is better.&mdash;I love and
venerate that good man:&mdash;not because he
begat you, but for his own great parts
and many virtues&mdash;by the bye, I know
more of him than you think for.&mdash;Tell
brother O&mdash;&mdash; I am glad to hear he is well,

name of the Bishop’s lady’s dog (that was
lost, and has been missing these two months)

<p class="salut">MY GOOD FRIEND,</p>

<p class="firstpara">I WISH to interest you in behalf of the
inclosed book&mdash;wrote by a greatly-esteemed
friend&mdash;a young man of much merit&mdash;and a
heart enriched with every virtue&mdash;the book
I beg you will snatch time to read with attention.&mdash;It
is an answer (as you will see) to
a flaming bigoted Mongrel against Toleration.&mdash;Swift
says, “Zeal is never so pleased
as when you set it a tearing.” He says truly.
Could you get the pamphlet (whose title I
forget), you would be better enabled to judge
of the force, truth, and strength of my
friend’s answer:&mdash;for my part, I love liberty
in every sense, whilst connected with honesty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[p. 330]</span>
and truth:&mdash;it has been shewn a bookseller,
but he happened to be the very man who
had just published a flimsy answer to the
same; consequently would not encourage
my friend’s, lest it should injure the sale
of his other.&mdash;Understand, my good friend,
that the author is very ill-calculated for
booksellers’ and printers’ jockeyship; which,
to a liberal mind fraught with high and
generous ideas, is death and the devil.</p>

<p>I own, I was guilty of teazing him into the
finishing this little work, with a view of
having it printed.&mdash;Now, my friend is not
richer than poets commonly are&mdash;and, in
short, will not run any risks.&mdash;I would
gladly stand the expence of printing; but I
am not richer than he;&mdash;I want it printed,
and request of you, if, upon perusing it, you
do not find it inimical, either to Religion,
Country, or Crown, that you contrive to
push it into the world without delay; but if,
upon mature deliberation, you find it dangerous,
with washed hands send it me back,
and set me down for an ass, in the trouble I
have given thee and myself.&mdash;Perhaps,
jaundiced by prejudice, I behold it with too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[p. 331]</span>
partial eyes; for I verily believe it will not
discredit the printer:&mdash;suppose you shew it in
confidence to the greatly amiable, the good
Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;e. I mention him in particular;
for sure I am his nobly benevolent soul
would start at the bare idea of religious persecution:&mdash;he
would, I trust, feel the full
force of my friend’s reasoning&mdash;and his
good opinion would be the best sanction
for endeavouring to push the work forward.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of meeting a gentleman
in our street one day last week, who seemed
to be so goodly a personage, that I said to
myself, There’s Sir Charles Grandison! His
figure was noble&mdash;his eye brightened with
kindness&mdash;the man of fashion and of sense
was conspicuous in him:&mdash;think how I
stared, when the gentleman accosted me&mdash;said,
he knew me through my friend
W&mdash;&mdash;e;&mdash;his name was *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. I bowed,
and stammered some nonsense&mdash;I was taken
by surprize.&mdash;I am in such a hurry, and the
pen is naught, that I fear you will scarcely
understand this scrawl.&mdash;Remember I give
you full powers over this work;&mdash;do what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[p. 332]</span>
you can, but do it soon, and make your report
to your friend,</p>

<p class="firstpara">I AND mine have a thousand things to
thank you for&mdash;shall I say the plain truth,
and own I am proud to know that you care
for me and my little ones? your friendly attention
to our interests proves it&mdash;but mortals
of your cast are oftener envied than loved:&mdash;the
majority, who are composed chiefly of
the narrow-minded or contracted hearts, and
of selfish avidity, cannot comprehend the
delight in doing as they would be done by&mdash;and
consequently cannot love what they do
not understand.&mdash;Excuse my nonsense, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[p. 333]</span>
ever write just what I think:&mdash;my business
was to give you some account why I delayed
the teas, and to thank you for your very
noble order.&mdash;Sir Jacob was here this afternoon,
and, if his looks tell truth, he is exceeding
well. H&mdash;&mdash; desires his love to you
and the worthy partner of your heart, to
whom I join with my spouse in wishing every
earthly felicity&mdash;heavenly you have both insured,
by being faithful stewards.&mdash;Sir Jacob
sent a parcel&mdash;which accompanies the teas&mdash;which
I hope will reach you safe and right,
as they set out to-morrow noon&mdash;Tell Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash;, I pray you, that the winter has used
me as roughly as it has him&mdash;I never have
been so unwell for these four months past;&mdash;but,
alas! one reason is, I do believe, that
I am past fifty;&mdash;but I hope with you, that
spring will set us all right.&mdash;As to complaints
in trade, there is nothing else&mdash;we are all
poor, all grumblers, all preaching œconomy&mdash;and
wishing our neighbours to practise it;&mdash;but
no one but the quite undone begins at
home. We are all patriots, all politicians,
all state-quacks, and all fools:&mdash;the ladies are
turned orators, and declaim in public, expose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[p. 334]</span>
their persons, and their erudition, to
every Jackanapes who can throw down half
a crown:&mdash;as to the men, they are past
saving;&mdash;as I can say no good, I will stop
where I am. And is my good friend Mr.
S&mdash;&mdash; unmarried still? Fie, fie upon him!
how can he enjoy any good alone? He should
take a partner, to lead him gently down the
hill of life&mdash;to superintend his linen and his
meat;&mdash;to give sweet poignancy to his beverage&mdash;and
talk him to sleep on nights.&mdash;Pray
tell him all I say&mdash;and also that the
majority are killing up the minority as fast as
they can:&mdash;nothing but duels, and rumours
of duels.&mdash;But is it now time to finish? Dear
Madam, forgive all my impertinences; and,
believe me, dame Sancho and self have a true
sense of your goodness, and repeatedly thank
you both for your kindness to,</p>

<p class="firstpara">“IN the multitude of Counsellors there
is wisdom,” sayeth the preacher&mdash;and at
this present crisis of national jeopardy, it
seemeth to me befitting for every honest
man to offer his mite of advice towards
public benefit and edification.&mdash;The vast
bounties offered for able-bodied men sheweth
the zeal and liberality of our wise lawgivers&mdash;yet
indicateth a scarcity of men. Now,
they seem to me to have overlooked one
resource (which appears obvious); a resource
which would greatly benefit the people
at large (by being more usefully employed),
and which are happily half-trained
already for the service of their country, by
being <em>powder-proof</em>, light, active, young fellows:&mdash;I
dare say you have anticipated my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[p. 336]</span>
scheme, which is to form ten companies at
least, out of the very numerous body of
hair-dressers:&mdash;they are, for the most part,
clean, clever, young men&mdash;and, as observed
above, the utility would be immense:&mdash;the
ladies, by once more getting the management
of their heads into their own
hands, might possibly regain their native
reason and œconomy&mdash;and the gentlemen
might be induced by mere necessity to comb
and care for their own heads;&mdash;those (I
mean) who have heads to care for.&mdash;If the
above scheme should happily take place,
among the many advantages too numerous
to particularize, which would of course result
from it, one not of the least magnitude
would be a prodigious saving in the
great momentous article of time; people of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ton</i> of both sexes (to speak within probability)
usually losing between two or three
hours daily on that important business.&mdash;My
plan, Mr. Editor, I have the comfort
to think, is replete with good;&mdash;it tends to
serve my king and country in the first instance&mdash;and
to cleanse, settle, and emancipate
from the cruel bondage of French, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[p. 337]</span>

<p class="salut">DEAR MADAM,</p>

<p class="firstpara">YOUR goodness is never tired with action!&mdash;How
many, very many times have
I to thank you, for your friendly interesting
yourself in our behalf!&mdash;You will say
thanks are irksome to a generous mind&mdash;so
I have done&mdash;but must first ask pardon
for a sin of omission.&mdash;I never sent you
word that your good son, as friendly as polite,
paid me the note directly, and would
not suffer it to run its sight:&mdash;they that
know Sir Jacob will not wonder; for he
is a Christian, which means, in my idea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[p. 338]</span>
a gentleman not of the modern sort.&mdash;Trade
is at so low an ebb, the greatest are glad to
see ready money:&mdash;in truth, we are a ruined
people&mdash;let hirelings affect to write and
talk as big as they please! and, what is
worse, religion and morality are vanished
with our prosperity&mdash;every good principle
seems to be leaving us:&mdash;as our means lessen,
luxury and every sort of expensive pleasure
increases.&mdash;The blessed Sabbath-day is
used by the trader for country excursions&mdash;tavern
dinners&mdash;rural walks&mdash;and then
whipping and galloping through dust and
over turnpikes drunk home.&mdash;The poorer
sort do any thing&mdash;but go to church;&mdash;they
take their dust in the field, and conclude
the sacred evening with riots, drunkenness,
and empty pockets:&mdash;the beau in upper life
hires his whisky and beast for twelve shillings;
his girl dressed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en militaire</i> for half a
guinea, and spends his whole week’s earnings
to look and be thought <em>quite the thing</em>.&mdash;And
for upper tiptop high life&mdash;cards
and music are called in, to dissipate the
chagrin of a tiresome, tedious Sunday’s evening.&mdash;The
example spreads downwards from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[p. 339]</span>
them to their domestics;&mdash;the laced valet
and the livery beau either debauch the
maids, or keep their girls:&mdash;thus profusion
and cursed dissipation fill the prisons, and
feed the gallows.&mdash;The clergy&mdash;hush! I will
not meddle with them&mdash;God forbid I
should!&mdash;they are pretty much the same
in all places;&mdash;but this I will affirm, where-ever
a preacher is in earnest in his duty,
and can <em>preach</em>, he will not want for crouded
congregations.&mdash;As to our politics&mdash;now
don’t laugh at me&mdash;for every one has a right
to be a politician; so have I; and though
only a poor, thick-lipped son of Afric! may
be as notable a Negro state-botcher as

Charles-Street, June 6, 1780.</p>

<p class="salut">DEAR AND MOST RESPECTED SIR,</p>

<p class="firstpara">IN the midst of the most cruel and ridiculous
confusion&mdash;I am now set down to
give you a very imperfect sketch of the maddest
people&mdash;that the maddest times were
ever plagued with.&mdash;The public prints have
informed you (without doubt) of last Friday’s
transactions;&mdash;the insanity of Ld. G.
G. and the worse than Negro barbarity of
the populace; the burnings and devastations
of each night&mdash;you will also see in the prints;&mdash;this
day, by consent, was set apart for
the farther consideration of the wished-for
repeal;&mdash;the people (who had their proper
cue from his lordship) assembled by ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[p. 342]</span>
o’clock in the morning.&mdash;Lord N&mdash;h, who
had been up in council at home till four in
the morning, got to the house before eleven,
just a quarter of an hour before the associators
reached Palace-yard:&mdash;but, I should
tell you, in council there was a deputation
from all parties;&mdash;the S&mdash;&mdash; party were for
prosecuting Lord G&mdash;&mdash;, and leaving him
at large;&mdash;the At&mdash;y G&mdash;&mdash;l laughed at the
idea, and declared it was doing just nothing;&mdash;the
M&mdash;&mdash;y were for his expulsion, and
so dropping him gently into insignificancy;&mdash;that
was thought wrong, as he would still
be industrious in mischief;&mdash;the R&mdash;&mdash;m
party, I should suppose, you will think
counselled best, which is, this day to expel
him the house&mdash;commit him to the Tower&mdash;and
then prosecute him at leisure&mdash;by
which means he will lose the opportunity of
getting a seat in the next parliament&mdash;and
have decent leisure to repent him of the
heavy evils he has occasioned.&mdash;There is at
this present moment at least a hundred thousand
poor, miserable ragged rabble, from
twelve to sixty years of age, with blue cockades
in their hats&mdash;besides half as many women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[p. 343]</span>
and children&mdash;all parading the streets&mdash;the
bridge&mdash;the park&mdash;ready for any and
every mischief.&mdash;Gracious God! what’s the
matter now? I was obliged to leave off&mdash;the
shouts of the mob&mdash;the horrid clashing
of swords&mdash;and the clutter of a multitude in
swiftest motion&mdash;drew me to the door&mdash;when
every one in the street was employed in
shutting up shop&mdash;It is now just five o’clock&mdash;the
ballad-singers are exhausting their musical
talents with the downfall of Popery,
S&mdash;h, and N&mdash;h. Lord S&mdash;h narrowly escaped
with life about an hour since;&mdash;the
mob seized his chariot going to the house,
broke his glasses, and, in struggling to get
his lordship out, somehow have cut his face;
the guards flew to his assistance&mdash;the light-horse
scowered the road, got his chariot, escorted
him from the coffee-house, where he
had fled for protection, to his carriage, and
guarded him bleeding very fast home. This&mdash;this&mdash;is
liberty! genuine British liberty!&mdash;This
instant about two thousand liberty
boys are swearing and swaggering by with
large sticks&mdash;thus armed in hopes of meeting
with the Irish chairmen and labourers&mdash;all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[p. 344]</span>
the guards are out&mdash;and all the horse;&mdash;the
poor fellows are just worn out for want
of rest&mdash;having been on duty ever since Friday.
Thank heaven, it rains; may it increase,
so as to send these deluded wretches
safe to their homes, their families, and wives!
About two this afternoon a large party took
it into their heads to visit the King and
Queen, and entered the Park for that purpose&mdash;but
found the guard too numerous to
be forced, and after some useless attempts
gave it up. It is reported, the house will
either be prorogued, or parliament dissolved,
this evening&mdash;as it is in vain to think of attending
any business while this anarchy lasts.</p>

<p>I cannot but felicitate you, my good friend,
upon the happy distance you are placed from
our scene of confusion.&mdash;May foul Discord
and her cursed train never nearer
approach your blessed abode! Tell Mrs.
S&mdash;&mdash;, her good heart would ach, did she
see the anxiety, the woe, in the faces of
mothers, wives, and sweethearts, each equally
anxious for the object of their wishes,
the beloved of their hearts. Mrs. Sancho
and self both cordially join in love and gratitude,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[p. 345]</span>
and every good wish&mdash;crowned with
the peace of God, which passeth all understanding,

<p class="sp1">The Sardinian ambassador offered 500 guineas
to the rabble, to save a painting of
our Saviour from the flames, and 1000
guineas not to destroy an exceeding fine organ:
the gentry told him, they would burn
him if they could get at him, and destroyed
the picture and organ directly. I am not
sorry I was born in Afric.&mdash;I shall tire you,
I fear&mdash;and, if I cannot get a frank, make
you pay dear for bad news. There is
about a thousand mad men, armed with
clubs, bludgeons, and crows, just now set
off for Newgate, to liberate, they say, their
honest comrades.&mdash;I wish they do not some
of them lose their lives of liberty before
morning. It is thought by many who discern
deeply, that there is more at the bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[p. 346]</span>
of this business than merely the repeal
of an act&mdash;which as has yet produced no
bad consequences, and perhaps never might.&mdash;I
am forced to own, that I am for an
universal toleration. Let us convert by our
example, and conquer by our meekness and
brotherly love!</p>

<p>Eight o’clock. Lord G&mdash;&mdash; G&mdash;&mdash; has
this moment announced to my Lords the

<p class="salut">MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p class="firstpara">GOVERNMENT is sunk in lethargic
stupor&mdash;anarchy reigns&mdash;when I look
back to the glorious time of a George II.
and a Pitt’s administration&mdash;my heart sinks
at the bitter contrast. We may now say
of England, as was heretofore said of Great
Babylon&mdash;“the beauty of the excellency of
the Chaldees is no more;”&mdash;the Fleet
Prison, the Marshalsea, King’s-Bench, both
Compters, Clerkenwell, and Tothill-Fields,
with Newgate, are flung open;&mdash;Newgate
partly burned, and 300 felons, from thence
only, let loose upon the world. Lord
M&mdash;&mdash;’s house in town suffered martyrdom;
and his sweet box at Caen Wood
escaped almost miraculously, for the mob
had just arrived, and were beginning with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[p. 348]</span>
it, when a strong detachment from the
guards and light-horse came most critically
to its rescue&mdash;the library, and, what is of
more consequence, papers and deeds of vast
value, were all cruelly consumed in the
flames. Ld. N&mdash;’s house was attacked; but
they had previous notice, and were ready
for them. The Bank, the Treasury, and
thirty of the chief noblemen’s houses, are
doomed to suffer by the insurgents. There
were six of the rioters killed at Ld.
M&mdash;&mdash;’s, and, what is remarkable, a
daring chap, escaped from Newgate, condemned
to die this day, was the most active
in mischief at Ld. M&mdash;&mdash;’s, and was
the first person shot by the soldiers; so he
found death a few hours sooner than if he
had not been released.&mdash;The ministry have
tried lenity, and have experienced its inutility;
and martial law is this night to be declared.&mdash;If
any body of people above ten
in number are seen together, and refuse to
disperse, they are to be fired at without any
further ceremony&mdash;so we expect terrible
work before morning.&mdash;The insurgents visited
the Tower, but it would not do:&mdash;they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[p. 349]</span>
had better luck in the Artillery-ground,
where they found and took to their use
500 stand of arms; a great error in city
politics, not to have secured them first.&mdash;It
is wonderful to hear the execrable nonsense
that is industriously circulated amongst the
credulous mob, who are told his M&mdash;&mdash;y
regularly goes to mass at Ld. P&mdash;re’s chaple&mdash;and
they believe it, and that he pays
out of his privy purse Peter-pence to
Rome. Such is the temper of the times&mdash;from
too relaxed a government;&mdash;and a
King and Queen on the throne who possess
every virtue. May God, in his mercy,
grant that the present scourge may operate
to our repentance and amendment! that it
may produce the fruits of better thinking,
better doing, and in the end make us a
wise, virtuous, and happy people!&mdash;I am,
dear Sir, truly, Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;’s and your
most grateful and obliged friend and servant,</p>

<p class="salut">DEAR SIR,</p>

<p class="firstpara">HAPPILY for us, the tumult begins
to subside:&mdash;last night much was threatened,
but nothing done&mdash;except in the early
part of the evening, when about four-score
or an hundred of the reformers
got decently knocked on the head;&mdash;they
were half killed by Mr. Langdale’s
spirits&mdash;so fell an easy conquest to the bayonet
and butt-end.&mdash;There are about fifty
taken prisoners&mdash;and not a blue cockade to
be seen:&mdash;the streets once more wear the
face of peace&mdash;and men seem once more to
resume their accustomed employments.&mdash;The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[p. 351]</span>
greatest losses have fallen upon the
great distiller near Holborn-bridge, and Lord
M&mdash;&mdash;; the former, alas! has lost his
whole fortune;&mdash;the latter, the greatest and
best collection of manuscript writings, with
one of the finest libraries in the kingdom.
Shall we call it a judgement?&mdash;or what shall
we call it? The thunder of their vengeance
has fallen upon Gin and Law&mdash;the two most
inflammatory things in the Christian world.&mdash;We
have a Coxheath and Warley of our
own; Hyde Park has a grand encampment,
with artillery, Park, &amp;c. &amp;c. St. James’s
Park has ditto&mdash;upon a smaller scale. The
Parks, and our West end of the town, exhibit
the features of French government.
This minute, thank God! this moment
Lord G. G. is taken. Sir F. Molineux has
him safe at the horse-guards. Bravo! he is
now going in state in an old hackney-coach,
escorted by a regiment of militia and troop
of light horse, to his apartments in the
Tower.</p>

warm wish of my heart; for, as I know not
the man to whose kindness I am so much
indebted, I may safely say, I know not the
man whose esteem I more ardently covet and
honour.&mdash;We are exceeding sorry to hear of
Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;’s indisposition; and hope, ere
this reaches you, she will be well, or greatly
mended.&mdash;The spring with us has been very
sickly&mdash;and the summer has brought with it
sick times;&mdash;sickness! cruel sickness! triumphs
through every part of the constitution:&mdash;the
State is sick&mdash;the Church (God
preserve it!) is sick&mdash;the Law, Navy, Army,
all sick&mdash;the people at large are sick
with taxes&mdash;the Ministry with Opposition,
and Opposition with Disappointment.&mdash;Since
my last, the temerity of the mob has gradually
subsided;&mdash;numbers of the unfortunate
rogues have been taken:&mdash;yesterday about
thirty were killed in and about Smithfield,
and two soldiers were killed in the affray.&mdash;There
is no certainty yet as to the number
of houses burnt and gutted&mdash;for every day
adds to the account&mdash;which is a proof how
industrious they were in their short reign.&mdash;Few
evils but are productive of some good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[p. 354]</span>

the times united the royal brothers;&mdash;the
two Dukes, dropping all past resentment,
made a filial tender of their services;&mdash;his
Majesty (God bless him!) as readily accepted
it&mdash;and on Thursday last the brothers met;&mdash;they
are now a triple cord&mdash;God grant a
blessing to the union! There is a report current
this day, that the mob of York city
have rose, and let 3000 French prisoners
out of York-castle&mdash;but it meets with very
little credit.&mdash;I do not believe they have any
thing like the number of French in those
parts&mdash;as I am informed the prisoners are
sent more to the western inland counties&mdash;but
every hour has its fresh cargo of lies.
The camp in St. James’s Park is daily increasing&mdash;that

the posts:&mdash;he looks exceeding grave.

your goings&mdash;and gives the blessings of increase

sensations&mdash;but a little reflection brought me
to myself.&mdash;Put thy trust in God, quoth I.&mdash;Mrs.
Sancho, whose virtues out-number
my vices (and I have enough for any one
mortal), feared for me and for her children
more than for herself.&mdash;She prayed too, I
dare say&mdash;and her prayers were heard.</p>

among us;&mdash;the fleet is but a secondary affair.&mdash;Pray
God send us some good news, to
chear our drooping apprehensions, and to

<p class="firstpara">I AM exceeding happy to inform you, that
at twelve this noon Lord L&mdash;&mdash; arrived
express from Sir H&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash;, with the pleasing
news, that, on the 12th of April, Charles
Town with its dependencies capitulated to
his Majesty’s arms, with the loss of 200
men on our side: by which fortunate event,
five ships of war, besides many frigates, and
one thousand seamen, were captured; and
seven thousand military, which compose the
garrison.&mdash;You will have pleasure, I am sure,
in finding so little blood shed&mdash;and in the
hope of its accelerating the so-much-wished-for
peace. Inclosed is a list of the prisoners,
which is from Lord Lincoln’s account&mdash;at
least I am confidently told so&mdash;and more than
that, it is said the late terrible riot was on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[p. 357]</span>
plan concerted between the French and Americans&mdash;upon
which their whole hope of
success was founded&mdash;they expected universal
bankruptcy would be the consequence, with
despair and every sad concomitant in its
train. By God’s goodness, we have escaped.
May we deserve so great mercy!</p>

Tower and Park guns confirmed it&mdash;the
guards encamped in the Parks fired each a
grand <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu de joye</i>&mdash;to-night we blaze in illuminations&mdash;and
to-morrow get up as poor
and discontented as ever. I wish, dear Sir,
very much to hear Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; is quite recovered&mdash;it
would indicate more than a common
want of feeling, were not my wife and self
anxious for the health and repose of such very
rare friends.&mdash;Indulge us, do, dear Sir,
with a single line, that we may joy in your
joy upon her amendment, or join our wishes
with yours to the God of mercy and love,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[p. 358]</span>
for her speedy recovery.&mdash;I inclose you an
evening paper&mdash;there is not much in it.
Upon consideration, I have my doubts concerning
the French and Americans being so
deep in the plan of our late riots;&mdash;there
requires, I think, a kind of supernatural
knowledge to adjust their motions so critically&mdash;but
you can judge far better than my
weak intellects;&mdash;therefore I will not pretend
to affirm any thing for truth, except
my sincere desire to approve myself most

tell you a piece of private news&mdash;which
gives ministry high hopes in the future.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[p. 359]</span>
General Washington, who was anxiously
watching Sir H. Clinton, no sooner saw
with certainty his intention, but he struck
his camp, and made the most rapid march
to New York&mdash;they expected it;&mdash;but, as
he was in superior force, they felt their
danger.&mdash;Sir H. Clinton, as soon as he
could possibly settle the garrison of Charles
Town, embarked with seven thousand men,
and got to New York in time to save it;&mdash;and
if he can possibly bring Washington
to a battle, it is thought the fate of America
will be soon decided.&mdash;Thank God!
the sky clears in that quarter&mdash;but we look
rather louring at home.&mdash;Ministry wish now
too plainly to disarm the subjects. Last
year, under dread of French invasion, the
good people were thanked for their military
favour.&mdash;Master tradesmen armed their journeymen
and apprentices&mdash;and the serjeants
of the guards absolutely made little fortunes
in teaching grown gentlemen of all descriptions
their exercise&mdash;in fancied uniforms,
and shining arms, they marched to
the right, wheeled to the left, and looked
battle-proof;&mdash;but now, it seems, they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[p. 360]</span>
not only useless, but offensive. How the
affair will end, God only knows!&mdash;I do not
like its complexion.&mdash;Government has ordered
them to give up their arms. If they
do, where is British liberty? If they refuse,
what is Administration? Many are gentlemen
of large property&mdash;Inns of Court Members,
Lawyers, &amp;c. dangerous people.&mdash;Time will
unveil the whole&mdash;May its lenient powers
pour the balm of healing councils on this
once glorious spot!&mdash;and make it as heretofore
the nurse of freedom&mdash;Europe’s fairest

<p class="firstpara">THERE is news this day arrived, which,
I believe, may be depended upon&mdash;that
Rodney brought the French admiral to a
second engagement about the 26th of May;
it unluckily fell calm, or the affair would
have been decisive.&mdash;The van of Rodney,
however, got up to Mons. Guichen’s fleet’s
rear, and gave it a hearty welcome.&mdash;Rodney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[p. 365]</span>
still keeps the seas, and prevents the French
fleet getting into Martinique.&mdash;The account
says, the enemy had the advantage of six
ships of the line more than Rodney;&mdash;and a
report runs current, that Walsingham has
fallen-in with the Dominica fleet, consisting
of thirty merchantmen and two frigates, and
taken most of them&mdash;but this wants confirmation.&mdash;Dear
Sir, I hope Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; is
better than mending&mdash;quite well&mdash;to whom
our most sincere respects.&mdash;Your order,
good Sir, is compleated, and, please God,
will be delivered to to-morrow’s waggon.</p>

<p>Excuse my scrawling hand&mdash;in truth my
eyes fail me; I feel myself since last winter
an old man all at once&mdash;the failure of eyes&mdash;the
loss of teeth&mdash;the thickness of hearing&mdash;are
all messengers sent in mercy and love, to
turn our thoughts to the important journey
which kings and great men seldom think
about:&mdash;it is for such as you to meditate on
time and eternity with true pleasure&mdash;looking
back, you have very much to comfort
you;&mdash;looking forward, you have all to hope.&mdash;As

How the devil it found you out, I cannot
imagine&mdash;I suppose the father of mischief
sent it to some richer neighbour at a greater
house; but as Johnny O&mdash;&mdash; was a character
better known, and much more esteemed, the

guardian angel watched the whole procedure&mdash;quoth
he, “I cannot wholly avert evils&mdash;but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[p. 367]</span>
I can turn them into blessings.&mdash;This
transitory pain shall not only refine his
blood, and cleanse him from other disorders&mdash;it
shall also lengthen his life, and purify
his heart:&mdash;the hour of affliction is the seed-time
of reflection&mdash;the good shall greatly
over-balance the evil.”&mdash;&mdash;As I am unfortunately
an adept in the gout, I ought to
send you a cart-load of cautions and advice&mdash;talk
nonsense about tight shoes, &amp;c. with
a farrago of stuff more teazing than the pain;&mdash;but
I hear the ladies visit you&mdash;and,
what’s better, friendship in the shape of

<p class="salut">MY DEAR AND HON. SIR,</p>

<p class="firstpara">MY long silence was the effect of a dearth
of news:&mdash;I could have wrote, it’s true&mdash;but
you would have ill relished a mass of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[p. 370]</span>
thanks upon favours received.&mdash;Minds like
yours diffuse blessings around; and, like
parent heaven, rest satisfied with the heart.&mdash;Your
goodness, dear Sir, is registered
there&mdash;and death will not expunge it.&mdash;No;
it will travel to the throne of grace, and the
Almighty will not wrong you.&mdash;I am just
risen from table with my friend R&mdash;&mdash;, and
we have toasted you most cordially in conjunction
with the amiable partner of your
heart, whom I hope in some happy time to
see&mdash;I may say, hunger and thirst to see&mdash;it’s
the wish of my heart.&mdash;Providence has
indulged me with many, and I will hope for
the completion of this.&mdash;But to the point:&mdash;a
gentleman in administration (with whom I
am upon good terms) about an hour since
called upon me, to give me some fresh news
just arrived from Admiral Geary’s fleet&mdash;an
engagement between a new French frigate,
pierced for 44 guns, mounting 32, called the
Nymphe, and the Flora English frigate,
Capt. Peere Williams<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, of 36 guns; the
Flora was peeping into Brest harbour, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[p. 371]</span>
the Nymphe was coming out full of men;&mdash;they
were both in the right mind for engagement&mdash;to
it they went&mdash;the Frenchman
began the affair at two cables length distance.&mdash;Williams
reserved his fire till they were
within half-cable’s length&mdash;it lasted with the
obstinacy of two enraged lions for above
two hours.&mdash;A French cutter came up to
teaze, but was sent off soon with a belly-full:&mdash;at
last the French captain, at the
head of his men, attempted boarding&mdash;when
our English hero met him&mdash;ran him
through the body&mdash;drove back his men&mdash;put
them under hatches&mdash;struck the colours&mdash;when
she was on fire in four different
places.&mdash;This affair happened the 10th ult.
and he has gallantly brought his prize into
Plymouth.&mdash;This is the greatest affair, take
the number of guns, men &amp;c. altogether,
that has happened this war. I am sorry to
remark, that if the French fleets in general
behave so well, it will be a service of danger
to meddle with them.</p>

<p>When Capt. Williams had conquered the
crew, they found sixty dead upon deck;&mdash;the
two ships exhibited a scene more like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[p. 372]</span>
slaughter-house, than any thing imaginable&mdash;These,
oh Christians! are the features of
war&mdash;and thus Most Christian Kings and
Defenders of Faith shew their zeal and love
for the dying commands of their Divine
Master.&mdash;Oh! friend, may every felicity be
thine, and those beloved by thee! may the
heartfelt sigh arise only at the tale of foreign
woes!&mdash;May that sacred tear of pity bedew
the cheek for misfortunes only such as humanity
may soften!&mdash;Mrs. Sancho joins me
in sincere and grateful respects to Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;

were I at this moment certain that Mrs.
S&mdash;&mdash; were as much better as I find myself;&mdash;but
when I consider the professional skill, as

in full hope that Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; is at this moment
better&mdash;much better&mdash;and, as one
spirit animates you both, you are better too.
May health diffuse itself throughout thy house!
and gladden all around it! I am better, my
dear Sir.&mdash;Tell my good Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;, I
shall live to see her, and to thank her too
most cordially in my child’s name: for my
part, your liberality in constant flow has
tired me out with thank-ye’s. Adieu, dear
Sir.&mdash;I never left a place with so much regret
as you made me leave B&mdash;&mdash; with;&mdash;nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[p. 381]</span>

<p class="firstpara">THIS is to thank you kindly for the
affectionate mark of your remembrance of
your old friend. After a long tedious
voyage, you happily reached the haven of
your repose&mdash;found your friends well&mdash;and
rejoiced their hearts by presenting, not a
prodigal, but a duteous, worthy, and obedient
child;&mdash;theirs be the joy&mdash;but yours
will be the gain.&mdash;As sure as light follows
the rising of the sun, and darkness the setting
of it;&mdash;so sure is goodness even in this
life its own reward of course. You are in the

is naturally and nobly employed.&mdash;We are in
the upper world playing the old foolish game&mdash;in
the same foolish way&mdash;and with the same
foolish set that trod the ministerial boards
when you left us. Your friend D&mdash;&mdash; tries
expedients, and gets nothing;&mdash;he is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[p. 384]</span>
deep in my debt; but as he has nothing,
I can expect nothing&mdash;for I never will consent
to do that to others, I would not they
should do unto me.&mdash;N&mdash;&mdash; does better,
and grows proud&mdash;I wish him joy.&mdash;My
dear youth, be proud of nothing but an
honest heart.&mdash;Let the sacred oracles be
your morn and evening counsellors&mdash;so
shall you truly enjoy life, and smile at the
approach of death.&mdash;I have been exceedingly
ill since you left us;&mdash;but, thank God! I
have got a fair fit of the gout, which will,
I hope, cleanse me from my whole budget of
complaints.&mdash;I shall live, I hope, till your
good present arrives;&mdash;and then I shall live
indeed.&mdash;Send the girls some cherry nuts,
if easy to be procured.&mdash;Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; joins

thy peace, health, and prosperity. Adieu.</p>

<p class="firstpara">WHY joy in the extreme should end
painfully, I cannot find out&mdash;but that it
does so, I will ever seriously maintain.
When I read the effusions of goodness, my
head turned;&mdash;but when I came to consider
the extensive and expensive weight and
scope of the contents, my reason reeled,
and idiotism took possession of me&mdash;till the
friendly tears, washing away the mills of
doubt, presented you to me as beings of a
purer, happier order&mdash;which God in his
mercy perhaps suffers to be scattered here
and there&mdash;thinly&mdash;that the lucky few who
know them may, at the same time, know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[p. 391]</span>
what man in his original state was intended
to be.&mdash;I gave your generous request a fair
hearing&mdash;the two first proposed places would
kill me, except (and that is impossible) Mrs.
Sancho was with me.</p>

<p>Inclination strongly points to the land of
friendship&mdash;where goodness ever blossoms&mdash;and
where N&mdash;f&mdash;d heals. At present I
take nothing, but am trying for a few days
what honest Nature, unperplexed by Art,
will do for me.&mdash;I am pretty much swelled
still; but I take short airings in the near
stages, such as Greenwich, Clapham, Newington,
&amp;c. &amp;c. Walking kills me. The
mind&mdash;the mind, my ever dear and honoured
friends&mdash;the mind requires her lullaby;&mdash;she
must have rest ere the body can be
in a state of comfort, she must enjoy peace,
and that must be found in still repose of
family and home. Mrs. Sancho, who speaks
by her tears, says what I will not pretend
to decypher;&mdash;I believe she most fervently
recommends you to that Being who best
knows you&mdash;for he gave you your talents.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
